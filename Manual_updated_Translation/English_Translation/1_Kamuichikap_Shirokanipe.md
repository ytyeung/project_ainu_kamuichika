# 梟の神の自ら歌った謡「銀の滴しずく降る降るまわりに」  
# The Owl God's Self Chant “Silver drops falling, falling all around”  
  
“Silver drops falling, falling all around, golden drops    
Falling, falling all around.” Singing the song,    
I descended along a river, passing over a human village.    
Browsing below, the poor of yesterday are now rich,     
The rich of yesterday are now poor.    
  
On the beach, children were playing with little toy bows and arrows [1].    
“Silver drops falling, falling all around, golden drops   
Falling, falling all around.” I sang and flew over the children.     
They ran beneath me, crying out:    
  
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!    
Hurry, shoot the bird!    
The first to hit the god's bird,    
The first to claim it,    
Is the true hero, the true strong one!"    
  
The children, once poor, now rich,     
With golden arrows and golden bows, were shooting at me.    
I let the golden arrows pass beneath me, fly above me.    
Among them, one child stood apart,    
With a simple wooden bow and arrow, joining the group.    
I could see his poverty, as his clothes told.    
Yet his eyes [2] shone with the shine of the greatest ancestors.   
A unique soul among the group.  
He took a simple arrow to his simple bow and aimed at me.    
  
The children, once poor, now rich, laughed at him loudly,     
saying:    
  
"Dirty boy [3], poor boy!    
That bird, the god's bird, ignores even our    
golden arrows [4]. Why would it take a poor arrow,     
a rotten wood arrow from    
A poor boy like you?"    
  
They kicked and beated the poor child.     
But the poor child paid no attention to them, only focused on me.    
Seeing this, I felt great pity.    
  
“Silver drops falling, falling all around,     
Golden drops falling, falling all around.” Singing the song,    
I slowly drew circles in the sky.     
The poor child, with one foot forward, one foot backward,    
Biting tightly his lower lip, aimed and released the arrow.     
The small arrow flew beautifully towards me,     
And I reached out my hand and caught it.    
  
Spinning around and around, I cut through the wind, and descended gracefully.    
The children ran, raising a sandstorm, rushing and shouting.    
I landed on the ground. The poor child reached me first and held me up.    
  
The children, once poor, now rich,  
Ran up from behind,  
Insulting him with twenty or thirty nasty names,  
Pushing and hitting the poor child,  
  
"Wretched child, poor child!  
How dare you take what is ours"  
  
The poor child covered me, pressed me tightly against his chest.    
Struggling, he broke free from the crowd,  
And ran away.   
  
The children, once poor, now rich,  
Threw stones and sticks after him,  
But the poor child paid no attention to them,  
Raising a sandstorm, he ran to a small hut.  
The child placed me through the first window,  
With supplementary words, telling the story of what had happened.  
  
Inside the house, an old couple came, shading their eyes with their hands.   
They were very poor, but they possessed the elegance of a gentleman and a lady.  
When they saw me, they bowed deeply in suprise.  
The old man straightened his belt and bowed to me.  
"Owl god, great god,  
Thank you for coming to our humble home.  
We once were among the wealthy,  
But now we are mere poor peasant.  
To have the god of the land [5], a great god,  
Stay with us, filled us with unease,   
But as the day is late, Great God,  
Please rest here tonight, and tomorrow,   
We shall send you off with only *inau*."  
  
He bowed again and again.    
The old woman laid a mat beneath the east window,    
And placed me there.  
Then everyone went asleep, and began to snore loudly.  
I sat between the ears of my armor, and around midnight, I awoke.  
  
“Silver drops falling, falling all around,     
Golden drops falling, falling all around.” I sang softly,   
And flew with a beautiful sound from the left side [6] of the house to the right side [7].  
As I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, god's treasures, fell around with a crystal sound.  
In a short moment, I filled the small house with beautiful treasures, god's treasures.  
  
“Silver drops falling, falling all around,     
Golden drops falling, falling all around.”  
I sang, and turned this small house into a house of gold, a large house.  
Inside, I created a storehouse of magnificent treasures.   
I quickly made beautiful robes to decorate the house.  
  
I decorated this great house. The house was more gorgeous than the home of any rich man.  
When I finished, I returned to my place,  
Sitting upon my armor, between the two ears [8].  
I made this family dream.  
In the dream, I told the story of Ainu *nishpa*, who was unlucky and became poor, being teased and bullied by those were once poor but now rich.  
I saw this and felt pity, and I am not an ordinary god.  
I stayed in their home, I gave them blessings.  
I told them.  
  
After a while I finished my work, dawn approached.  
The family woke up together.  
Rubbing their eyes, they looked around the house,   
All fell to the ground with surprise.   
The old woman wept, and large tears come from the old man's eyes.  
And soon, the old man rose,  
Came before me, bowed twenty or thirty times,  
And said:  
  
"We thought it was only a dream,  
But it is real.   
Your visit to our humble home is more than we could ever ask [9].  
God of the land, Great God, with your pity on our misfortune,  
You grant us the greatest blessing [10]."  
He wept as he spoke.  
  
Then, the old man cut wood for *inau*.  
He made beautiful *inau*, and decorated me.  
The old woman dressed neatly.  
The child helped her gather firewood and  
Draw water, preparing to brew sake.  
In an instant, six barrels of sake were placed in the high seat.  
  
Then, I spoke with the old lady of the hearth [11], the old goddess,  
And other gods, discussing the ancient epics [12].  
After two days or so, the house was filled with the scent of sake,  
A favourite of the gods.  
  
Then, they dressed the child in old clothes,   
And sent him as a messenger,  
To invite those once poor and now rich in the village [13].  
  
I watched his leave. The child went from house to house,  
Stating his purpose.  
Those once poor, and now rich laughed aloud.  
"How strange that the poor can brew sake,   
Have delicious food, and invite others?  
Let us go and see what is so funny."  
  
So they said, and came in a crowd,  
From afar, when they saw the house,  
They were shocked and ashamed.   
Some turned back.  
Some came to the house,   
And fell to the ground in shock.  
  
The lady of the house came out,  
Taking each person by hand, invited them to come in.  
Everyone crawled in, unable to raise their heads.  
  
The master of the house stood up,  
And spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird [14].  
He told the story of what had happened.  
"We were poor and unable to visit each other freely,   
But the great god took pity on us.   
We had no bad intentions, and we received these blessings.   
From now on, we are all members of the same family in the village,  
Therefore we wish for everyone to be friendly and visit each other."  
  
When the master of the house finished speaking, the people rubbed their hands together many times, and apologized to him.   
The people agreed to live in harmony from now on.    
Everyone came and worshipped me.  
  
When this was done, everyone's hearts softened,   
And they held a lively feast.  
  
I laughed and talked with the god of fire, the god of the house [15],  
And the god of the sacred shelf [16].  
Watching the people dance and sing, I was deeply amused.   
Then, after two or three days, the feast ended.  
  
Seeing the people being friendly with each other,  
I felt relieved, and said goodbye to the god of fire, the god of the house,  
the god of the sacred shelf.  
When this was done, I returned to my home.  
Before I arrived, my home was already filled with beautiful *inau*,  
And fine sake.  
  
Then, I sent messengers to the gods near and far,    
Inviting them to a great feast.    
At the feast, I told the gods,   
The details of my visit to the human village,    
the situation, and the events that happened,    
And the gods praised me greatly.    
When the gods were about to leave,     
I gave each of them two or three beautiful *inau*.  
  
Looking at that Ainu village, it is now at peace.    
The people live in harmony, and the *Nishpa*    
Becomes the village head.    
His son is now grown up,    
With his wife and his child.  
The son honors his parents, and when brewing sake,    
He always sends me *inau* and sake at the start of the feast.    
I sit behind the people,    
Always,    
Watch over the land of men.  
  
This was the tale the Owl God told.
