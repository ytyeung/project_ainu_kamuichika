## The Sea God's Own Chant “Atuika tomatomaki kuntuteashi hm hm!” 

Atuika tomatomaki kuntuteashi hm hm!

My tall elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My tall elder sisters, six elder sisters,
My short elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My short elder sisters, six elder sisters,
Had raisen me. 

I built a high platform, beside the pile of treasures.
I sat on the platform, carving and engraving sheath,
From sunrise to sunset, I repeated my work days by days.

Every day, when morning came, 
My elder brothers carried their quivers on their backs,  
And went out with my elder sisters. 
And when evening came, 
They returned with tired faces,
Empty-handed. 

My elder sisters, although tired, 
Prepared the meal, and set me the tray of the meal.
After they ate the meals, and cleaned up the dishes,
My elder brothers made arrows busily.
The quivers were finally full.
They were so tired and fell asleep, snoring loudly.

The next day, before sunrise,
Everyone got up, my sisters prepared the meal, 
And set me the tray of the meal.

When everyone had eaten, they brought their quivers again,  
And went out. 
Again, in the evening,
They returned with tired faces, 
Empty-handed.
My elder sisters prepared the meals.   
My elder brothers made arrows.
Tasks are repeated days by days.

One day, again, my elder brothers and elder sisters,  
Brought their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures.
Then I rose from the high platform, took a golden bow
And a golden arrow, and went outside.

The sea was wide and calm.
The whales were playing,
From the east to the west of the sea,   
With splashing sound.

At the east of the sea, my six tall elder sisters, 
Held hands and made a circle.
My six short elder sisters, 
Drove the whales into the circle.
My six tall elder brothers, 
My six short elder brothers,
Aimed and shot the whales in the circle.

Their arrows passed beneath the whales。 
Their arrows passed above the whales.  
Days by days, they repeated the same tasks.  

In the center of the sea,
A large whale and its calf were playing,   
Up and down, with splashing sound.

From a distance,
I fitted a golden arrow to my golden bow,
Aimed and shot.
I got both the whale and the calf at once with single arrow.

I cut one whale in two halves,
And threw one half into the circle of my elder sisters.
Then I brought the remaining one and a half whales,
Toward the human world,
Under my tail. 

When I arrived at Otashut Village,
I pushed the one and a half whales,
Up onto the beach beside the village.

I swam back slowly.
Over the sea, 
Someone came breathlessly beside me.
And I saw it was the seagull.

Breathlessly, the seagull said,
“Tominkarikur Kamuikarikur Isoyankekur  

The Brave God, The Great God,
Why have you given such a great gift of the sea to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes and sickles, 
To cut, slice, and crop the great gift of the sea. 

The Brave God, The Great God, 
Please quickly take back the great gift of the sea. 
Even though you give the humans such a great blessing,
The lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Are not grateful, but have acted in disrespect.”  

I laughed and said,
“I have gave the whales to the humans.
Now the whales are belonged to them. 
The humans slice at their possessions with sickles,
Or crop with axes,
What is wrong for humans to treat the whales,  
As the food source as they please?" 

The seagull looked confused,
But I did not care about,   
And swam slowly over the sea.
As the day was growing dark, I arrived at my sea.

The twelve elder brothers, 
The twelve elder sisters, 
were struggling, 
Unable to carry their half piece of whale.  
They were shouting loudly,  
And making slow progress towards the east of the sea.

I was surpised,   
But I did not care about, and went home.
I sat on the high platform, 
Looking toward the human world.

I saw men and women in fine dresses, 
Surrounded the one and a half whales,
Rejoicing and dancing over the gift of the sea. 
Beautiful mats were spread on the sand dunes behind,
On the mats, the chief of Otashut Village wore six robes 
Bundled with belts, and six coats.
The chief wore a divine crown, a fine crown from ancestors. 
There was a divine sword, granted by God, at his waist.
Looking as beautiful as a god, the chief raised his hands high
And worshipping. 

The villagers were crying,
And rejoicing over the gift of the sea.
The words of seagull about the humans,  
Carving the whales with axes and sickles,  
Was not fact.
Instead, the chief and the villagers took out the divine sword, 
Which was their the most precious treasure,
And used it to slice and carry.

My elder brothers and elder sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something
Seemed to appear in the window, so
I turned and looked, and on the window
Was a golden cup, filled to overflowing
With sake, and on it
Were sacred chopsticks with gohei attached,
Going back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am a person from Otasutsu Village,
And with great reverence, I offer you sake."

The village chief of Otasutsu Village,
Representing all the villagers,
spoke in detail of the circumstances in which he offered his thanks to me,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Great God, if not for you, Brave God,
Who would have pitied our village, where there was a famine
And we were so desperately
Lacking in food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing over the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake,
Added a small nusa,
And offer our thanks to the Great God."
This was what
The gohei-adorned chopsticks declared, going back and forth.
So I rose, took
The golden cup, and raised it to my forehead,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Poured a little fine sake into each,
And placed the golden cup on the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the raised platform
And saw that the cup had disappeared, along with the chopsticks.
Then, carving sheaths
And engraving sheaths, presently
I raised my face and saw
That the house was full of beautiful gohei,
And the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning
Was flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then again, two or three days passed,
And at last, outside the house,
I heard my brothers and
Sisters pulling the whale,
Shouting loudly. I was amazed.
As I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces
Withered. When everyone had entered and saw the many gohei,
They were surprised and worshipped many times over.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of the gods' favorite
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful gohei,
Invited the gods of distant places and the gods of nearby places,
And held a grand banquet. My sisters
Boiled the whale and offered it to the gods,
And the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I rose
And told in detail how there had been a famine in the human world
And, feeling pity, I had beached the sea bounty,
And how, when I had done good to the humans, the evil gods
Were jealous of it, and the sea grebe had slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu Village
Had taken those words and offered his thanks to me,
And how the gohei-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy,
And the gods
All nodded in unison,
Praising me.
Then again, we held a grand banquet,
And the sounds of the gods
Dancing and leaping here and there
Made a beautiful sound, and my sisters
Carried the choshi and went around pouring sake between the seats,
And sang in beautiful voices with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the banquet closed.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,
And the gods bent low at the waist
And bowed many times over,
And all returned to their own homes.
After that, as always, my eldest brother, six brothers,
My eldest sister, six sisters, my younger sister, six sisters,
My younger brother, six brothers, were with me,
And whenever the humans made sake,
They would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.
Now the humans have no lack of food
And live in peace, without any troubles,
So I am at ease.
