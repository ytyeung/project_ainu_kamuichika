## The Sea God's Own Chant “Atuika tomatomaki kuntuteashi hm hm!” 

Atuika tomatomaki kuntuteashi hm hm!

My tall elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My tall elder sisters, six elder sisters,
My short elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My short elder sisters, six elder sisters,
Had raisen me. 

I built a high platform, beside the pile of treasures.
I sat on that platform, carving and engraving sheaths
From sunrise to sunset, I repeated my work days by days.

Every day, when morning came, 
My brothers
Shouldered their quivers and went out with my sisters,
And when evening came, they returned with tired faces,
Empty-handed, and my sisters,
Though tired, prepared the meals, set a tray before me,
Ate their own meals, and when the dishes were cleared away,
Then my brothers would busily make arrows.
When the quivers were full, they were all so tired
They would sleep, snoring loudly and fall asleep.
The next day, while it was still dark,
Everyone would get up, my sisters would prepare the meals and set a tray before me,
And when everyone had eaten, they would shoulder their quivers again
And go out. Again, in the evening,
They would return with tired faces, empty-handed,
My sisters would prepare the meals, my brothers would make arrows,
Always doing the same thing.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters
Shouldered their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but presently
I rose from the raised platform, took a golden bow
And a golden arrow, and went outside.
I saw the sea was wide and calm,
And whales were playing, splashing,
To the east and to the west of the sea. Then,
To the east of the sea, my eldest sister, six sisters, joined hands and made a circle,
My younger sister, six sisters, drove the whales into the circle,
My eldest brother, six brothers, my younger brother, six brothers,
Aimed and shot at the whales in the circle, and the arrows
Passed beneath the whales, passed above them.
Every day they did this sort of thing.
I saw in the center of the sea
A large whale and its calf playing, splashing,
Up and down, so from a distant place
I notched a golden arrow to my golden bow
And aimed and shot, piercing both whale and calf
At once with a single arrow.
Then I cut the whale in half
And threw half of it into my sisters' circle.
Then, with one and a half whales
Under its tail, I went toward the land of humans,
Arrived at Otasutsu Village,
And pushed the one and a half whales
Up onto the village beach.
Then I swam slowly back
Over the sea, when someone
Came running breathlessly beside me,
And I saw it was the sea grebe.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Brave God, Great God,
Why have you given such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes
And sickles to cut and poke and
Whittle away at the great sea bounty. Brave God,
Great God, please quickly
Take back the great sea bounty. Even though you give them so much sea bounty,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not feel grateful and do such things."
So I laughed and said,
"I gave it to the humans,
So now it is theirs. If the humans
Poke at their possessions with sickles or
Whittle them away with axes, isn't it all right
For them to eat as they please?
What's wrong with that?" Then
The sea grebe looked disconsolate,
But I paid it no mind and swam slowly
Over the sea, and
As the day was growing dark, I arrived at my sea.
I saw
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, unable to carry
Their half of the whale, all struggling together,
Making slow progress to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.
I paid them no mind and went home
And sat on the raised platform.
Then, looking back toward the human world,
I saw fine men and
Fine women, in full dress, surrounding
The one and a half whales I had beached,
Rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty, and on the dunes behind,
Splendid mats were spread,
And on them the village chief of Otasutsu Village
Was wearing six robes, with a bundled sash, wearing six robes,
And wearing a fine divine crown, an ancestral crown,
On his head, and a divinely granted sword at his waist,
Looking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high
And worshipping. The humans were crying
And rejoicing over the sea bounty.
What the grebe had said about the humans
Poking at the whale I had beached with
Axes and sickles was not true;
the village chief and
The villagers were taking out
The divine sword, which they had long considered
The most precious of treasures,
And using it to cut the meat and carry it away.
Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something
Seemed to appear in the window, so
I turned and looked, and on the window
Was a golden cup, filled to overflowing
With sake, and on it
Were sacred chopsticks with gohei attached,
Going back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am a person from Otasutsu Village,
And with great reverence, I offer you sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu Village,
Representing all the villagers,
spoke in detail of the circumstances in which he offered his thanks to me,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Great God, if not for you, Brave God,
Who would have pitied our village, where there was a famine
And we were so desperately
Lacking in food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing over the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake,
Added a small nusa,
And offer our thanks to the Great God."
This was what
The gohei-adorned chopsticks declared, going back and forth.
So I rose, took
The golden cup, and raised it to my forehead,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Poured a little fine sake into each,
And placed the golden cup on the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the raised platform
And saw that the cup had disappeared, along with the chopsticks.
Then, carving sheaths
And engraving sheaths, presently
I raised my face and saw
That the house was full of beautiful gohei,
And the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning
Was flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then again, two or three days passed,
And at last, outside the house,
I heard my brothers and
Sisters pulling the whale,
Shouting loudly. I was amazed.
As I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces
Withered. When everyone had entered and saw the many gohei,
They were surprised and worshipped many times over.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of the gods' favorite
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful gohei,
Invited the gods of distant places and the gods of nearby places,
And held a grand banquet. My sisters
Boiled the whale and offered it to the gods,
And the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I rose
And told in detail how there had been a famine in the human world
And, feeling pity, I had beached the sea bounty,
And how, when I had done good to the humans, the evil gods
Were jealous of it, and the sea grebe had slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu Village
Had taken those words and offered his thanks to me,
And how the gohei-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy,
And the gods
All nodded in unison,
Praising me.
Then again, we held a grand banquet,
And the sounds of the gods
Dancing and leaping here and there
Made a beautiful sound, and my sisters
Carried the choshi and went around pouring sake between the seats,
And sang in beautiful voices with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the banquet closed.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,
And the gods bent low at the waist
And bowed many times over,
And all returned to their own homes.
After that, as always, my eldest brother, six brothers,
My eldest sister, six sisters, my younger sister, six sisters,
My younger brother, six brothers, were with me,
And whenever the humans made sake,
They would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.
Now the humans have no lack of food
And live in peace, without any troubles,
So I am at ease.
