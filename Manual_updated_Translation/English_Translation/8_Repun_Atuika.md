## The Sea God's Own Chant “Atuika tomatomaki kuntuteashi hm hm!” 

Atuika tomatomaki kuntuteashi hm hm!

My tall elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My tall elder sisters, six elder sisters,
My short elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My short elder sisters, six elder sisters,
Had raisen me. 

I built a high platform, beside the pile of treasures.
I sat on the platform, carving and engraving sheath,
From sunrise to sunset, I repeated my work days by days.

Every day, when morning came, 
My elder brothers carried their quivers on their backs,  
And went out with my elder sisters. 
And when evening came, 
They returned with tired faces,
Empty-handed. 

My elder sisters, although tired, 
Prepared the meal, and set me the tray of the meal.
After they ate the meals, and cleaned up the dishes,
My elder brothers made arrows busily.
The quivers were finally full.
They were so tired and fell asleep, snoring loudly.

The next day, before sunrise,
Everyone got up, my sisters prepared the meal, 
And set me the tray of the meal.

When everyone had eaten, they brought their quivers again,  
And went out. 
Again, in the evening,
They returned with tired faces, 
Empty-handed.
My elder sisters prepared the meals.   
My elder brothers made arrows.
Tasks are repeated days by days.

One day, again, my elder brothers and elder sisters,  
Brought their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures.
Then I rose from the high platform, took a golden bow
And a golden arrow, and went outside.

The sea was wide and calm.
The whales were playing,
From the east to the west of the sea,   
With splashing sound.

At the east of the sea, my six tall elder sisters, 
Held hands and made a circle.
My six short elder sisters, 
Drove the whales into the circle.
My six tall elder brothers, 
My six short elder brothers,
Aimed and shot the whales in the circle.

Their arrows passed beneath the whales。 
Their arrows passed above the whales.  
Days by days, they repeated the same tasks.  

In the center of the sea,
A large whale and its calf were playing,   
Up and down, with splashing sound.

From a distance,
I fitted a golden arrow to my golden bow,
Aimed and shot.
I got both the whale and the calf at once with single arrow.

I cut one whale in two halves,
And threw one half into the circle of my elder sisters.
Then I brought the remaining one and a half whales,
Toward the human world,
Under my tail. 

When I arrived at Otashut Village,
I pushed the one and a half whales,
Up onto the beach beside the village.

I swam back slowly.
Over the sea, 
Someone came breathlessly beside me.
And I saw it was the seagull.

Breathlessly, the seagull said,
“Tominkarikur Kamuikarikur Isoyankekur  

The Brave God, The Great God,
Why have you given such a great gift from the sea to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes and sickles, 
To cut, slice, and crop the great gift from the sea. 

The Brave God, The Great God, 
Please quickly take back the great gift from the sea. 
Even though you give the humans such a great blessing,
The lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Are not grateful, but have acted in disrespect.”  

I laughed and said,
“I have gave the whales to the humans.
Now the whales are belonged to them. 
The humans slice at their possessions with sickles,
Or crop with axes,
What is wrong for humans to treat the whales,  
As the food source as they please?" 

The seagull looked confused,
But I did not care about,   
And swam slowly over the sea.
As the day was growing dark, I arrived at my sea.

The twelve elder brothers, 
The twelve elder sisters, 
were struggling, 
Unable to carry their half piece of whale.  
They were shouting loudly,  
And making slow progress towards the east of the sea.

I was surprised,   
But I did not care about, and went home.
I sat on the high platform, 
Looking toward the human world.

I saw men and women in fine dresses, 
Surrounded the one and a half whales,
Rejoicing and dancing over the gift of the sea. 
Beautiful mats were spread on the sand dunes behind,
On the mats, the chief of Otashut Village wore six robes 
Bundled with belts, and six coats.
The chief wore a divine crown, a fine crown from ancestors. 
There was a divine sword, granted by God, at his waist.
Looking as beautiful as a god, the chief raised his hands high
And worshipping. 

The villagers were crying,
And rejoicing over the gift of the sea.
The words of seagull about the humans,  
Carving the whales with axes and sickles,  
Was not the fact.
The chief and the villagers took out the divine sword, 
Their the most precious treasure,
To slice the whales and carry away.

My elder brothers and sisters did not return yet.
Two or three days later, 
Something appeared at the window.
I turned around,
And found a golden cup,  
Overflowed with sake.  
On top of the golden cup, 
There were sacred chopsticks with Inau attached,
Going back and forth, delivering the message,  
"I come from Otashut Village.
Here is my offer with great respect."

The village chief of Otashut Village,
Representing all the villagers,
Spoke in detail for their gratitude to me.
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
The Brave God, The Great God,
Who would took pity on our village, where there was a famine.  
We were starving to death.

Thank you for reviving us, 
With the great gift from the sea.
We have made some fine sake,
With decoration of Inau,
To express our gratitude to the Great God."
The sacred chopsticks with Inau attached,
Going back and forth,
Delivered the message.  

I rose, took the golden cup, 
Raised the cup to my forehead, 
Then put the cup down.   
I opened the lids of the six sake barrels at the Upper Seat,
And poured a small amount of the fine sake into each barrel. 
Then I placed the golden cup at the window.

When I completed, I sat on the platform, and saw that,
The golden cup had disappeared,  
Along with the sacred chopsticks.
Then, I continued to carve and engrave sheath.
I raised my head, and saw that,
The house was full of beautiful Inau,
with white clouds swirling , 
And white lightning flashing.   
"How beautiful it is.", I thought.

Two or three days had passed.
Finally, outside the house,
I heard my elder brothers and sisters, 
Shouting loudly,
Pulling the whale.
I was surprised.

I observed my elder brothers and sisters when they entered the house.
Their tiredness was shown on their faces.  
When all of them entered the house,
They were surprised by the numerous Inau, 
And worshipped many times over.

Meanwhile, the six sake barrels at the Eastern Seat
Were overflowing, 
The house was filled with the scent of sake,  
A favourite of the gods.  
I decorated the house with the beautiful Inau,
And invited the gods near and far,  
To a grand banquet.   
My elder sisters boiled and offered the whale to the gods.
The gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.

When the banquet was at its height, I stood up,  
Telling in detail about the famine in the human world.
I took pity, and pushed the whales to the beach.
When I had done good to humans, 
The evil gods who were jealous,  
Had sent the seagull to slander humans in front of me.
And the chief of Otashut Village,
Offered his thanks to me,
With the sacred chopsticks decorated with Inau as the messenger.

The gods, nodded in unison, praised me.
We continued the grand banquet.
The gods danced with beautiful sound. 
My sisters carried the wine flasks,  
Went around between the seats, 
Pouring sake, 
And sang with the goddesses in beautiful voices.
Two or three days passed, 
The banquet concluded.

I gave each of the gods two or three beautiful inau.  
The gods bowed many times, expressing thanks to me.
Then they all returned to their homes.

After that, as always, 
My tall elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My tall elder sisters, six elder sisters,
My short elder brothers, six elder brothers, 
My short elder sisters, six elder sisters,
Were always with me.

When humans had made sake,
They offered fine sake and Inau to my place.

Now humans have sufficient food,  
And live in peace, without any troubles.
My heart is comforted.
