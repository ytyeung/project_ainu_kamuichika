## The Freshwater Mussel's Own Chant “Tonupeka Ranran”  
  
Tonupeka Ranran  
  
Fierce sunlight had dried up the place I called home.  
I was about to die.  
"Please give us water. Save our lives.  
Water! Water!" We cried.  
  
From the direction of the shore,  
A woman came with a basket on her back.  
When we cried, she passed by us.  
Saw us, she said,  
"Wretched mussels, hateful mussels,   
Why are you crying  
And making too much noise?"  
She stepped on us, kicked us,  
Crushed our shells,  
And went far away into the mountains.  
  
"Pain! Suffering! Water! Water!" We cried.  
From the direction of the shore,  
Another maiden came with a basket on her back.  
We cried,   
"Please give us water. Save our lives.    
Pain! Suffering! Water! Water!"  
  
The maiden, as beautiful and divine as a goddess,  
Came to our side, saw us, and took pity to us,    
"How pitiful! The heat is unbearable.   
The bedding of the mussels has dried up.    
They are longing for water.  
What has happened here?  
It seems that they have been stepped on..."  
  
Saying this, she gathered up all of us,  
Placed us in butterbur leaves,  
And put us in a clear lake.  
With the pure, cold water, we became healthy again,    
And regained our strength.  
  
Then, we began to investigate the nature of those two women.  
The hateful woman who came first and stepped on us,  
The wicked woman, was the younger sister of Samayunkur.  
The maiden who took pity to us and helped us,   
The gentle and graceful one,  
Was the younger sister of Okikirmui.  
  
Because the younger sister of Samayunkur was evil and hateful,  
Her millet fields withered.  
For the younger sister of Okikirmui,  
Her millet fields flourished.  
  
That year, the younger sister of Okikirmui harvested a great abundance.  
She knew that the great harvest was because of us,  
She used a mussel shell to harvest the millet ears.  
  
After that, every year,   
Human women came to use mussel shells to harvest millet ears.  
  
This was the tale told by a freshwater mussel.
