## The Fox's Self Chant “Towa towa to”

Towatowato,
One day, I went to the seaside to gather food.
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
As I walked, I looked ahead and saw
A whale had washed ashore on the beach.
Humans were all dressed in finery,
Joyfully celebrating the sea's bounty, dancing in the sea's bounty,
People cutting meat and carrying it back and forth,
Important people offering thanks and prayers for the sea's bounty,
Some sharpening knives—the beach was black with them.
Seeing this, I was greatly pleased.
"Ah, I must hurry and get there,
I want to receive even a little bit," I thought,
And shouting, "Banzai! Banzai!"
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I went closer and closer, but when I arrived,
Contrary to all expectations,
What I thought was a whale washed ashore
Was just a dog's toilet on the beach,
A large mountain of dung.
That is what I had mistaken for a whale.
What I thought were humans rejoicing in the sea's bounty, dancing in the sea's bounty,
Cutting and carrying the meat,
Were just crows
Pecking at the dung, scattering the dung,
Flying this way and that.
I was furious.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
Running from the seaside,
I looked ahead and saw
A boat, and in that boat
Two humans were exchanging condolences.
"Oh, what sudden event
Has caused them to do such a thing? Perhaps
Someone has capsized with the boat,
Ah, I must hurry closer
And hear what they are saying."
Thinking this, I shouted loudly, "Hohohoi!"
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and went to see,
But what I thought was a boat was just
A rock on the beach, and what I thought were people
Were just two large cormorants.
I saw the two large cormorants stretching and shrinking their long necks
As if they were exchanging condolences.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and went up the river,
And far upstream
Two women were standing in the shallows, weeping together.
Seeing this, I was startled.
"Oh, what bad thing has happened,
What ill omen has come that they are weeping so?
Ah, I must hurry and arrive
And hear what they are saying."
Thinking this,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and went to see,
But in the middle of the river were two fish weirs,
And the stakes of the two weirs were being hit by the current and shaking,
And I thought the two women were looking up and down at them and
Weeping together.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
Then again, going up the river,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and came back.
I looked ahead and saw
That for some reason
My house was ablaze,
The smoke rising into the sky
Like gathering clouds. Seeing this, I
Was so startled I nearly fainted.
Shouting in a woman's voice,
I jumped up, and from the other side someone
Shouted loudly, "Hoi!" and flew to my side.
It was my wife, with a startled look on her face, breathless,
"Husband, what is wrong?" she said, and I saw
That what looked like a fire
Was just my house as it always was.
No fire, no smoke.
It was just that my wife was hulling grain,
And at that moment the wind blew strongly, and the winnowed millet
Chaff was being blown away,
And I saw it as smoke.
I went out to find food but found none, and on top of that
I shouted so loudly that my wife
Was startled and threw away the millet she was winnowing
Along with the chaff,
So we have nothing to eat tonight.
I was furious and threw myself onto the floor
And went to sleep.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
So
The fox head narrated.
