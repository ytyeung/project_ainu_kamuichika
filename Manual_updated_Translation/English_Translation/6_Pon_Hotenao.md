Hotenao  
One day, I was bored, and wandered to riverside.  
While I was playing, a short man appeared.  
As he went down along the river,   
I also went down along the river.  
When He came up along the river,   
I also came up along the river.   
I blocked his path.  
  
Six times after going down along the river,  
Six times after going up along the river,  
The short man,  
Finally showing impatience on his face,   
Speaking in anger,  
  
“Pii tuntun, pii tuntun!  
You little brat,   
You bad little brat,   
If you keep doing this,  
Tell me the past and current names of this cape!”  
  
Hearing this, I replied with a laugh.  
“Everyone knows the past and current names of this cape!  
In the past, noble humans and great gods were living here.  
This cape was called the Cape of gods.  
But the epochs have declined,  
It is now called the Cape of Inau!”  
  
The short man then said,  
“Pii tuntun, pii tuntun!  
You little brat,  
If you are really knowledgeable,  
Tell me the past and current names of this river.”  
  
Listening to this, I responded,  
“Everyone knows the past and current names of this river!  
In the past, of the greatest epoch,   
This river was called the Turbulent Flow,  
But now, the epochs have declined,   
The River is now called the Slow Flow.”  
  
The short man further challenged,  
“Pii tuntun, pii tuntun!  
If you know so much,  
Let's reveal our true identities, both of us.”  
  
Hearing this, I replied,  
“Evryone knows your true identity!  
Long time ago, Okikirmui went into the mountains,  
And built a hunting lodge.  
He made a hearth frame with hazel wood,  
And exposed the hearth frame to the fire.  
Then the hearth frame dried out completely.   
When Okikirmui stepped on one side,   
The other side lifted up.  
Okikirmui was angry,  
And threw the hearth frame away, down into the river.  
  
The hearth frame floated along the river,  
And arrived the sea.  
It was struck by waves of the sea near and far,and the gods saw it.  
The hearth frame was made by the hands of the great Okikirmui,  
But it was drifting aimlessly and rotting in the seawater without any purpose.  
The gods took pity on it,   
And turned the hearth frame into a fish.  
And it was named the Hearth Frame Fish.  
Not knowing its own origins,  
The Hearth Frame Fish transforms itself as a man and wanders around.  
You are the Hearth Frame Fish.”  
  
When I completed speaking,   
The face expression of the short man changed drastically.  
“Pii tuntun, pii tuntun!  
You, the young wolf cub.”  
  
When he spoke, a splash sound heard.  
He jumped into the sea,  
And I saw a red fish, swinging its tail fin,   
Swimming far away into the sea.  
  
This was the tale told by the Junior Wolf God.
