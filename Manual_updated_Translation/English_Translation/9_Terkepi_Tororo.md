## The Frog's Own Chant “Tororo hanrok hanrok!”   

Tororo hanrok hanrok!

One day, I hopped and played in the grassland.
I saw a house, and looked inside   
Through the doorway.
There, treasures piled, a high platform stood beside.
A youth sat on the platform, head down, 
carving decoration of a sheath.

I wanted to play a mischievous trick to him. 
Therefore I sat on the sill,
Cried, "Tororo hanrok hanrok!".
The youth raised his hand that held the knife,
Looked at me, and smiled,
"Is this your chant? Is this your drinking song?
I would like to hear more."

Delighted, I cried, "Tororo hanrok hanrok!".
The youth spoke again,
"Is this your chant? Is this your drinking song?
I wish to hear it closer."

My heart swelled with joy. 
I leaped down with grace,
To the hearth's edge below, in that humble place,
Cried, "Tororo hanrok hanrok!",
The youth spoke again,
"Is this your chant? Is this your drinking song?
I wish to hear it closer."

At these words, I was overjoyed, and with a bound,
I leaped to the hearth's corner, safe and sound,
Crying, "Tororo hanrok hanrok!" with cheer,
But suddenly! The youth rose up, drawing near!
I thought he would approach, but instead, he seized,
A burning log, immense, my spirit displeased,
He hurled it at me, a sound that blocked my way,
And after that, I knew nothing of the day.

When I awoke, dazed and in a fright,
I found myself at the garbage heap's end, in dim light,
A frog lay dead, its belly swollen and vast,
And I sat between its ears, my die was cast.

I looked around, and realized with dread,
This was no ordinary home, as I had instead,
Believed, but the house of Okikirmui, so grand,
A being of power, like a god in the land!

And I, in ignorance, had played a trick,
On Okikirmui himself, with a foolish flick.
Now I die this wretched, insignificant death,
So, frogs of the future, take heed with each breath,
Never play tricks on humans, I implore,
Or you may suffer a fate to deplore."

The swollen frog spoke thus, and then expired,
A lesson learned too late, a life retired.
