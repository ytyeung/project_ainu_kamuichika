## The Frog's Own Chant “Tororo hanrok hanrok!”       
    
Tororo hanrok hanrok!    
    
One day, I was hopping and playing in the grassland.    
I saw a house, and I went to the doorway.       
Looking inside, treasures piled high.      
A high platform stood beside.    
A young man sat on the platform, got his head down,     
carving decoration of a sheath.    
    
I wanted to play a mischievous trick to him.     
Therefore I sat on the threshold,    
And called out,   
"Tororo hanrok hanrok!".    
The young man raised his hand that held the knife,    
Looked at me, and smiled,    
"Is this your chant? Is this your joyful drinking song?    
I would like to hear more."    
    
Delighted, I called out,   
"Tororo hanrok hanrok!".    
The young man spoke again,    
"Is this your chant? Is this your joyful drinking song?    
I wish to hear it closer."    
    
My heart was filled with joy.     
I hopped down with grace,    
To the Lower Seat by the hearth.      
And called out,   
"Tororo hanrok hanrok!",    
The young man spoke again,    
"Is this your chant? Is this your joyful drinking song?    
I wish to hear it closer."    
    
At these words, I was cheer.    
I hopped to the Upper Seat by the hearth.    
And called out,   
"Tororo hanrok hanrok!".    
Suddenly, the young man stood up.    
I thought he would approach me.     
But instead, he picked up a large burning firewood,     
Threw it at me.     
As if a loud sound blocked my way,    
I knew nothing of the day.    
    
When I awoke,    
At the end of the garbage dump, I found myself.    
I was sitting,     
Between the two ears of a dead frog with bloated belly.     
    
I looked around carefully,       
And realized that this was not an ordinary house,          
But was actually the house of Okikirmui,     
Who was as powerful as a god.    
And I had played a trick on him without even knowing he was Okikirmui.    
    
I died such a pointless, miserable death,    
Frogs of the future,     
Never play tricks on humans.    
    
The bloated frog died after telling his own tale.
