Harit kunna 

One day, in a fine weather,
I was looking around from my swamp,  
With only eyes and mouth exposed.
Coming from the beach,
I heard voices.
I saw two young men approaching together.

The first man seemed to be a hero,
Showing the qualities,
And as beautiful as a god.
However, the second man, who was following,
Looked bad, with a pale face.
They were talking about something as they came, 
When they passed by my swamp, just in front of me, 
The pale-faced man stopped, and covered his nose.
“The smell is nasty, this nasty swamp! 
Passing by this awful swamp makes me dirty. 
What is this? It stinks so much.”
He said.

I listened, and so angry that 
I forgot that I was hiding.
I jumped out of the mud. 
When I jumped out, 
The ground cracked and broke into pieces.
Grinding my teeth, I chased after them fiercely.

The first man, noticing that something was wrong, 
Turned around like a fish swimming back,
Went under the arm of the pale-faced man,
Ran away.
I chased after the pale-faced man for a few steps, 
Quickly caught up swallowed him whole.

Then I chased after the other man with all my speed,
Arrived at the back of a human village, 
A large village.

Over there was the old lady of the hearth, the divine goddess,
Wearing red robes, six layers of robes, with a belt tied, 
Wearing six layers of coats, 
Holding a red staff,
Flying towards me.

“Why are you coming to this Ainu village? 
Go home, go back home.”
As she said this, she raised her red staff, her metal staff,
And struck me.
Flames rained down on me from the staff.

I did not care at all.
Grinding my teeth, I chased after the man.
The man ran around the village like a spinning wheel.

I chased after the man.
The ground cracked and broke into pieces. 
The village was in a mess.
People were holding hands of their wives.
People were holding hands of their children, 
Crying, screaming, Fleeing.
A scene of mess.

I did not care at all,
I raised a dust storm.
The old lady of the hearth was running towards me, 
Huge flames were flying over my head.

Then, the man jumped into a house, 
And immediately jumped out again.
I saw him fitting a small mugwort arrow to a small mugwort bow,
Smiling, aiming at me.

Seeing that, I thought it was funny. 
“How can such a small mugwort arrow hurt anyone?”
Thinking that, I ground my teeth and tried to swallow him whole. 

But the man shot my neck hard with the arrow.
I did not know what happened. 
I woke up,
And I sat between the ears of a huge dragon.

The villagers gathered. 
The young man who I chased was giving instructions in a loud voice.
Everyone finely chopped up my corpse,
Carried it to one place, burnt it, 
And threw the ashes behind the rocks of the mountain.

Finally I knew.
At first, I thought he was just an ordinary human, just a young man. 
Indeed he was Okikirmui, the hero of the gods.

A terrible bad god, a demon god, that was me.
Because I was near the human village, 
Okikirmui, thinking of the village, angered me, 
Made me chase him, and killed me with a mugwort arrow.

The pale-faced man who I swallowed earlier, 
I thought he was a human, 
But Okikirmui made the doll from his excreta, 
And brought it with him.

I was a demon god, 
But now I have been sent to the hell, the terrible, dark land.
From now on, there will be no danger in the human world.

I was a terrible demon god, 
But I was defeated by the strategy of single human.
I died a meaningless death, a bad death.
