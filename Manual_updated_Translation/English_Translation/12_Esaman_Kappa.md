## The Otter's Own Chant “Kappa reureu kappa”  
  
Kappa reureu kappa  
  
One day, I played along the river.  
Swimming down, I came to water-drawing place of Samayunkur.  
The younger sister of Samayunkur, as beautiful as a goddess, was there.    
She was holding a bucket in one hand and  
A bundle of bulrushes in the other hand [1].  
  
I poked my head out at the edge of the river, And asked,  
"Do you have father?  
Do you have mother?"  
The maiden flustered, and looked around.  
When she found me, her face filled with anger.  
"You hateful flat head, you wicked flat head,  
have insulted me [2]! Friends with baring fangs [3], go and get him!"  
  
At her call, large dogs rushed out,  
Showing their fangs at me.   
Frightened, I dove into bottom of the river,    
And fled downstream.  
  
Then, at Okikirmui's water-drawing place,  
I poked my head out again.  
Okikirmui's younger sister, as beautiful as a goddess, was there.  
She was holding a bucket in one hand and  
A bundle of bulrushes in the other hand.  
  
I said to her:  
"Do you have father?  
Do you have mother?"  
  
The maiden, flustered, looked around,   
And found me.   
Her face filled with anger.   
"You hateful flat head, you wicked flat head,  
Daring to insult me!   
Friends with baring fangs, go and get him!"  
  
At her call, large dogs rushed out.  
Remembering what happened before, I found it funny.  
I tried to dive into bottom of the river to escape,  
But never thought of the dogs would do this.  
Baring their fangs, they leapt into the river after me,  
Hauled me ashore, bit and tore at my head and body,  
Until I lost conscious.  
When I woke up, I was sitting  
Between the two ears of a large otter.  
  
I knew that Samayunkur and Okikirmui  
Had neither father nor mother,   
And still I played such evil jokes.   
I was punished, killed by Okikirmui's dogs.  
A meaningless, wicked death.  
From now on, otters, never play such evil jokes.  
  
The otter told his story.  
  
## Footnote  
  
(Chiri)  
  
[1] kinatantuka: A bundle of bulrushes. Bulrushes can be woven into mats, but dry bulrushes cannot be woven directly, so they must be slightly moistened before use. This is also mentioned in the story, which is the reason the woman brought them to the riverside.  
  
[2] i-okapushpa: It is our taboo to say the names of deceased parents or relatives, or talk about them in ordinary times, which is called i-okapushpa. In addition, digging out things that others have hidden and telling everyone, or saying things that are difficult for that person to say, or their behavior in front of others, etc., is also called i-okapushpa.  
  
[3] nimakitara: Baring fangs. Refers to dogs. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them. The wild animals are afraid of being attacked by dogs with bared teeth. They give dogs such a name to express their fear.
