# Prologue

Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Embraced by beautiful nature, like innocent children, they lived leisurely and happily, truly the darlings of nature; how fortunate they were! In winter, on land, they kicked through the thick snow covering the forests, braving the freezing cold, crossing mountains to hunt bears. In summer, at sea, they were accompanied by the cool breeze on the green waves and the songs of white gulls, floating on leaf-like boats, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they bathed in the gentle sunlight, singing with the eternally chirping birds, picking butterburs (fuki) and mugwort (yomogi). In the autumn of red leaves, they parted the pampas grass, neatly headed and swayed by the autumn wind, until night fell when the bonfires for catching salmon had died out; in the valleys, accompanied by the calls of deer calling to their companions, weaving dreams under the round moon. Ah, what a joyful life! A peaceful realm, now all in the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone rapid changes, mountains and fields have become villages, villages have become towns, gradually being developed and cultivated. The natural scenery from ancient times has faded, and where have the many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? Only the remaining members of our tribe can only open our eyes in surprise at the ever-advancing world. And from those eyes, the beautiful spiritual light of the people, whose every move was once governed by religious beliefs, has disappeared, filled with anxiety, burning with dissatisfaction, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others—what a pitiful sight, ah, things that are about to perish... that is our name now; what a sad name we have! In the past, our happy ancestors could not have imagined, not even in the slightest, that their homeland would eventually become so miserable. Time continues to flow ceaselessly, and the world develops and advances infinitely. In the fierce arena of competition, among us who are exposing the ugliness of defeat, one day, if even two or three strong people can emerge and walk alongside the ever-advancing era, that day will eventually come. That is our urgent wish, that is what we pray for day and night. But... our beloved ancestors, the many languages they used to communicate with each other in daily life, the many beautiful words passed down from generation to generation, will those things also disappear mercilessly, along with the weak who are about to perish? Ah, that is too sad and regrettable. As an Ainu, raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights, on snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather together and record, with clumsy strokes, a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors. If it can be read by many people who understand us, I will feel truly infinite joy and supreme happiness, together with our ancestors.
