# Prologue

Long time ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Embraced by beautiful nature, they lived leisurely and happily as innocent children. They were truly the darlings of nature. How joyful they were!   

In winter, they kicked through the thick snow covering the forests, braving the freezing cold, crossing mountains to hunt bears. In summer, they were accompanied by the cool breeze on the green waves of the sea and the songs of white gulls, floating on leaf-like boats, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, singing with the eternally chirping birds, picking butterburs and mugwort. In the autumn of red leaves, they passed through the pampas grass swayed by the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon had died out in late evenings. In the valleys, accompanied by the calls of deer to their companions, they wove dreams under the round moon. What a joyful life it was! A peaceful realm, but now all were in the past. Dreams have been shattered for decades. This land has undergone rapid changes. Mountains and fields have become villages. Villages have gradually being developed into towns.  

The ancient natural scenery has faded away unnoticed. Where have the many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? We, the few remaining members of our tribe, can only stare in surprise at the ever-advancing world. From those eyes, the beautiful soul of the people of the past, whose was once governed by religious beliefs in every aspect, has disappeared. These eyes, are now filled with anxiety, dissatisfaction, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others. What a pitiful sight it is. Oh, those who are about to perish... that is our current name, what a sad name we have.

In the past, our happy ancestors never imagined even in the slightest that their homeland would eventually become so miserable. 

Time continues to flow ceaselessly. The world develops and advances continuously. In the fierce arena of competition, we are being defeated in ugliness. However, one day, two or three strong individuals will arise and walk alongside the ever-advancing era. That day will eventually come. This is our urgent wish. This is our prayer for day and night. 

But... the language that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other in daily life, the beautiful words passed down from generation to generation, will all these also disappear mercilessly, along with the weak who are about to perish? This is too sad and regrettable. 

Born as an Ainu and raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights, on snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather and record, with clumsy strokes, one or two short pieces of stories told by our ancestors.   

If the many of you who know us can read the stories, I, together with our ancestors, will truly feel the infinite joy and supreme happiness.
