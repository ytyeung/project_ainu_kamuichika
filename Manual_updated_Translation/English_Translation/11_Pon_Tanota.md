## The Little Okikirmui's Own Chant “This sand is red, so red”   
  
[This sand is red, so red]  
(Tanota hurehure)  
  
One day, when I went upstream of a river for leisure,  
I encountered the son of a devil.  
As always, the devil's son is beautiful in appearance,  
Beautiful in face, wearing a black robe,  
Holding a walnut bow and walnut arrows.  
  
Seeing me, he grinned and said,  
“Little Okikirmui, let's play.  
I will show you how to cut off the root of fish.”  
With these words, he fitted a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,  
And shot the arrow towards the spring of the waters.  
The spring flowed with walnut water, muddy water,  
The salmon were swimming upstream against the current,  
But, they hated the walnut water,   
They wept, and turned away.   
  
The devil's son saw this and grinned.  
My anger ignited when I saw this.  
I fitted a silver arrow on my small silver bow,  
And shot the arrow towards the spring.  
  
The spring flowed with silver water, pure and sweet,  
The salmon, once wept when they retreated,  
Regained their strength in the pure silver water.  
They laughed and played, with the splashing sound,  
Climbing upstream.   
  
The devil's son saw this,   
Revealed his fierece nature.  
“If you insist, I will cut off the root of the deer.”  
  
Saying this, he fitted a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,  
And shot the arrow towards the sky,  
A walnut wind swept through the trees of the mountains,  
And formed a whirlwind.  
Among the trees of the mountains,   
The deer, were risen by the wind,   
Groups by groups,   
Into the sky.  
  
The devil's son grinned.  
  
I was extremely angry when I saw this.  
I fitted a silver arrow to my silver bow,  
And shot the arrow towards the departing deer.  
A silver wind descended from the heavens, clean and refreshing,  
The deer, groups by groups,   
Were blown back to the trees of the mountains.  
  
The devil's son, saw this,   
Further revealed his fierece nature.  
“You arrogant fool [1], if you insist on this,   
Let us compete our strength.”  
With these words, he took off his outter robe.  
  
I, too, was left only with a thin garment,  
And fighted with him.   
He held me tight.  
We wrestled, each striving for dominance,  
At times I gained, at times he did.  
The devil's son is really strong,  
But, in the end,  
At a certain moment, I unleashed my power,  
All of my power,  
to lift the devil's son upon my shoulders,  
Knocking him hard upon the mountain rocks,  
With a deafening sound of crash.  
  
I killed the devil's son,   
And kicked him into Hell,  
The surrounding returned into silence.  
  
When it was done, I returned along the river,  
The laughter of the salmon in the river,    
Their playing sound, reached my ears.    
The sound of water splashing, were lively and joyous.    
Among the trees of the mountains,  
The laughter of the deer,  
Their playing sound, filled the mountains,  
The deer were foraging in leisure.  
  
When I saw this,  
I felt peace in my mind,   
Therefore I returned home.  
  
The Little Okikirmui told his own tale.

This story is about Okikirmui's father and pon nitnekamui's father. They had a very fierce war before, so this pon okikirmui and pon nitnekamui became enemies. The details of the war between their fathers are described in detail in another story.
