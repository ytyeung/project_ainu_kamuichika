## The Little Okikirmui's Own Chant “This sand is red, so red” 

[This sand is red, so red]

One day, when I went upstream of a river for leisure,
I encountered the child of a devil.
As always, the devil's child is beautiful in appearance,
Beautiful in face, wearing a black robe,
Holding a walnut bow and walnut arrows.

Seeing me, he grinned and said,
“Little Okikirmui, let's play.
I will show you how to cut off the root of fish.”
With these words, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the spring of the waters.
The spring gushed forth with walnut water, turbid and foul,
The salmon swam against the current,
But, loathing the walnut water, they wept,
And turned away. The demon's child, beholding this,
Merely grinned.

My rage ignited at this sight,
I drew forth my small bow of silver,
Nocked a silver arrow, and shot it towards the spring.
The spring gushed forth with silver water, clear and sweet,
The salmon, weeping as they retreated,
Regained their vigor in the clear silver water,
Laughing and playing, splashing and frolicking,
Swimming against the current. The demon's child, beholding this,
Revealed the impatience born within him,
"If you insist, then I shall sever the source of the deer."
So saying, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the sky,
A walnut wind swept through the trees of the mountains,
Forming a whirlwind.
Among the trees of the mountains, stags in droves,
Does in droves, were lifted by the wind,
Risen neatly into the sky.
The demon's child grinned.

My fury knew no bounds,
I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow,
And shot it towards the departing deer.
A silver wind descended from the heavens, clear and refreshing,
Stags in droves,
Does in droves,
Were blown back to the trees of the mountains.

The demon's child, beholding this,
Once more revealed the impatience born within him,
"Insolent fool, if you insist
On this, then let us test our strength."
With these words, he removed his upper garment.
I, too, was left in but a thin robe,
And grappled with him. He held me tight.
From then on, we wrestled, each striving for dominance,
At times I gained the upper hand, at times he did,
But the demon child's strength was truly astonishing.
Yet, in the end,
At a certain moment, I unleashed the power of my loins,
The power of my entire being,
And hoisted the demon child upon my shoulders,
Slamming him hard upon the mountain rocks,
With a deafening crash.
Having slain him, and cast him into hell,
Silence fell all around.

When all was done, I returned along the river,
The laughter of the salmon in the river,
The sounds of their play, were lively and joyous,
Splashing and frolicking, reaching my ears.
Among the trees of the mountains,
The laughter of the stags and does,
The sounds of their play, filled the mountains,
There they were, here they were,
Leisurely foraging. Seeing this,
I felt at peace, and returned to
My home.
So spoke Okikirmui.
