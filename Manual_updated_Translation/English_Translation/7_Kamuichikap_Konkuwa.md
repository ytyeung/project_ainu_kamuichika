## The Owl God's Self Chant “Konkuwa” 

“Konkuwa

In the past, I spoke loud,
As loud as the sound of pulling a bow string wrapped in cherry bark,
Resonating from the center of the bow.
Now I am weakened and getting old.
If someone can speak in fluent and strong voice,
If someone is confident to be a messenger,
I will send the one to Heaven for a five-and-a-half negotiation."
I spoke, and tapped on the lid of a hooped barrel.

Suddenly, I heard someone saying at the entrance,
"Who else but me can speak in fluent and strong voice,
And full of confidence as a messenger?"
Looking around, there was a young crow.
I let the young crow come into the house. 
Then, tapping on the lid of the hooped barrel,
I told the young crow the details of the negotiation.

Three days passed, 
I was explaining the third point.
The young crow dozed off by the hearth.
Seeing this, I was enraged and slapped the young crow.  
Feathers scattered, the young crow died.

Again, I tapped on the lid of the hooped barrel,
"If someone is confident to be a messenger,
I will send the one to Heaven for the five-and-a-half negotiation."
When I said, again, someone was at the entrance, saying,
"Who else but me can speak in fluent and strong voice,
Enough to stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
Looking around, there was a mountain jay.
I let the mountain jay come into the house,  
Then again, tapping on the lid of the hooped barrel,   
I explained the five-and-a-half negotiation.

Four days passed,  
When I was explaining the fourth task,
The mountain jay dozed off by the hearth.
I was angry, and slapped the mountain jay.
Feathers scattered, the mountain jay died.

Then again, I tapped on the lid of the hooped barrel,
"If someone can speak in fluent and strong voice,
If someone is confident to be a messenger,
I will send the one to Heaven for the five-and-a-half negotiation."
When I said, someone came in with a respectful attitude, 
Looking around, there was a young brown dipper [1], 
With handsome appearance,
Sitting on the Left Seat. 

I tapped on the lid of the hooped barrel,  
Continued to explain the five-and-a-half negotiation days and nights. 
Looking up, the young brown dipper showed no sign of fatigue,
Was still listening days and nights.
On the sixth day, I finished speaking.  
The young brown dipper immediately,
Through the skylight, went to Heaven.

This is the summary of the negotiation.
There was a famine in the human world. 
The humans were starving to death. 
The reason seemed to be,
In Heaven,
The god who governed deer and the god who governed fish,
Decided not to send deer and fish after discussion.

Whatever the other gods pleaded, 
The two gods ignored.
When the humans went hunting in the mountains, 
There were no deer.
When the humans went fishing in the rivers, 
There were no fish.
I was angry when I saw this. 
Therefore I dispatched a messenger to the deer god and the fish god
For negotiation.

Many days had passed,   
I heard a soft sound from the sky.
Suddenly, someone came in. 
Looking around, the young brown dipper returned,
Now even more handsome, with further refined dignity,  
Began to tell the response.

The deer god and the fish god,
Refused to release deer and fish.
When humans caught deer,  
They beaten the heads of dears with wooden clubs.
When humans took the deerkin, 
They discarded the heads of the dears in the mountains.
When humans caught fish,
They killed the fish by hitting their heads with rotten wood.
The deer, naked and cried,
Returned to the deer god. 
The fish, with rotten wood in their mouths,
Returned to the fish god. 

The deer god and the fish god were angry.
They chatted and decided not to release any deer or fish to human world,  
However, when humans learned to treat deer and fish with respect,  
They would release deer and fish again.
These were the words from the deer god and fish god,
The young brown dipper told in detail.

After hearing the words, I praised the young brown dipper.
Browsing below, humans really treated deer and fish crudely.
Therefore, to prevent the crude behaviours in the future,
I taught humans in their dreams.

Humans also realized their crude behaviours.
Therefore, they crafted their fishing tools,  
Which are as beautiful as Inau.
When humans caught a deer, 
They decorated the head of the deer as an offering to god. 

The fish held the beautiful Inau in their mouths,
Returned to the fish god happily.
The deer danced and showed their beautiful headpieces,
Returned to the deer god.
The deer god and the fish god were delighted.
They released more fish and deer.

Humans now live without hunger,
And I am relieved.

I am old and weakened,
About time to return to Heaven.
However, I could not leave with a peaceful mind,
When the human world where I protected was suffered from famine, 
When humans were starving to death.

Therefore, I had been here until now.
Now my worries have gone. 
I have appointed the young and strongest hero to protect the human world.
Today I will return to Heaven.” 

The divine owl god, the ancient god, 
Who protected the land of humans,
Told the tale and returned to Heaven.]
