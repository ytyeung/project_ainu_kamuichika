"Konkuwa

In the past, I spoke loud,
As loud as the sound of pulling a bow string wrapped in cherry bark,
Resonating from the center of the bow.
Now I am weakened and getting old.
If someone can speak in fluent and strong voice,
If someone is confident to be a messenger,
I will send the one to Heaven for a five-and-a-half negotiation."
I spoke, and tapped on the lid of a hooped barrel.

Suddenly, I heard someone saying at the entrance,
"Who else but me can speak in fluent and strong voice,
And full of confidence as a messenger?"
Looking around, there was a young crow.
I let the young crow come into the house. 
Then, tapping on the lid of the hooped barrel,
I told the young crow the details of the negotiation.

Three days passed, 
I was explaining the third point.
The young crow dozed off by the hearth.
Seeing this, I was enraged and slapped the young crow.  
Feathers scattered, the young crow died.

Again, I tapped on the lid of the hooped barrel,
"If someone is confident to be a messenger,
I will send the one to Heaven for the five-and-a-half negotiation."
When I said, again, someone was at the entrance, saying,
"Who else but me can speak in fluent and strong voice,
Enough to stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
Looking around, there was a mountain jay.
I let the mountain jay come into the house,  
Then again, tapping on the lid of the hooped barrel,   
I explained the five-and-a-half negotiation.

Four days passed,  
When I was explaining the fourth task,
The mountain jay dozed off by the hearth.
I was angry, and slapped the mountain jay.
Feathers scattered, the mountain jay died.

Then again, I tapped on the lid of the hooped barrel,
"If someone can speak in fluent and strong voice,
If someone is confident to be a messenger,
I will send the one to Heaven for the five-and-a-half negotiation."
When I said, someone came in with a respectful attitude, 
Looking around, there was a young brown dipper, 
With handsome appearance,
Sitting on the Left Seat. 

I tapped on the lid of the hooped barrel,  
Continued to explain the five-and-a-half negotiation days and nights. 
Looking up, the young brown dipper showed no sign of fatigue,
Was still listening days and nights.
On the sixth day, I finished speaking.  
The young brown dipper immediately,
Through the skylight, went to Heaven.

This is the summary of the negotiation.
There was a famine in the human world. 
The humans were starving to death. 
The reason seemed to be,
In Heaven,
The god who governed deer and the god who governed fish,
Decided not to send deer and fish after discussion.

Whatever the other gods pleaded, 
The two gods ignored.
When the humans went hunting in the mountains, 
There were no deer.
When the humans went fishing in the rivers, 
There were no fish.
I was angry when I saw this. 
Therefore I dispatched a messenger to the deer god and the fish god
For negotiation.

Many days had passed,   
I heard a faint sound in the sky.
Suddenly, someone came in. 
Looking around, the young brown dipper returned,
Now even more handsome, with further refined dignity,  
Began to state the response.

The reason why the deer god and the fish god of Heaven
had not released deer or fish until today
was that when humans caught deer,
they hit the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,
they discarded the deer's head as it was in the mountain forest.
When they caught fish,
they killed them by hitting their heads with rotten wood,
so the deer, crying naked,
returned to the deer god's side, and the fish
returned to the fish god with rotten wood in their mouths. The deer god and the fish god
were angry and consulted, and decided not to release deer or
fish. But if from now on
humans treat deer and fish
with care, then they will release deer
and release fish, the deer god and
the fish god said, he stated in detail.
After hearing that, I presented
praise to the young river crow, and saw that indeed
the humans had treated deer and fish
crudely.
From then on, in order to prevent such things from happening again,
I taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,
and the humans also
realized that they were wrong, and from then on,
they made fishing tools as beautifully as making *nusa*,
and used them to catch fish. When they caught a deer, they also decorated the deer's head
beautifully and performed rituals, so
the fish happily held the beautiful *gohei* in their mouths
and went to the fish god, and the deer
happily combed their new *sakayaki* and returned to the deer god.
The deer god and
the fish god were very happy,
and released a lot of fish, and released a lot of deer.
The humans now have no difficulties,
no hunger, and live happily,
I was relieved to see this.
I am old and weakened,
so I was going to go to Heaven,
but I could not go without concern because there was a famine in the human country that I was protecting and the humans were about to starve to death,
so I have been here until now, but now I have
no worries, so I will leave the strongest
young hero behind me to protect the human world,
and today I am going to Heaven."
And so, the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the country,
told the story and went to Heaven.
