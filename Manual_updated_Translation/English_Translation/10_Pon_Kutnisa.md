Kutnisa kutunkutun

One day, I played near the source of the river.
There, I saw a small boy, hunched over,
Trying to build a weir of walnut wood, driving piles.
When he saw me, he said,
"Who are you? Are you my nephew? Please help me!"
I looked, and it was a weir of walnut.
Walnut water, a muddy torrent, flowed.
The salmon tried to swim upstream,
but they hated the walnut water
and cried as they turned back.
My anger flared.
I snatched the mallet from the boy's hand
and struck him in the small of his back.
I struck so hard it echoed, "Pon!"
I broke his spine, killed him,
and kicked him down to hell.
I shook his walnut stakes,
as if to reach beyond six hells.
Then, with all the strength in my back and body,
I broke the stakes from their roots
and kicked them down to hell.
Clear wind and clear water flowed from the source,
and the salmon, who had cried as they left,
revived in the clear wind and water.
They frolicked and laughed with great joy,
Splashing and swimming upstream.
Seeing this, my heart was comforted
and I returned along the river.

The Little Okikirmui told his own tale.
