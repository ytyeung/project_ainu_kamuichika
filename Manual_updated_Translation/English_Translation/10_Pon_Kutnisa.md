## The Little Okikirmui's Own Chant “Kutnisa kutunkutun”        
  
Kutnisa kutunkutun  
  
One day, I played near the source of the river.  
I saw a short man, bending his back,  
Installing piles for a fish trap of walnut wood.  
  
When he saw me, he said,  
"Who are you? Are you my nephew? Please help me!"  
I looked, because of the fish trap of walnut wood,  
Walnut water, muddy water, flowed out.  
The salmon tried to swim upstream,  
But they hated the walnut water.  
They wept as they turned back.  
  
I was extremely angry.     
I grabbed the hammer from the man's hand,     
And struck him at his back.  
I struck so hard, with a loud echo.    
I broke his backbone, killed him,  
And kicked him down to Hell.  
I shook the foundations of the walnut piles,  
The foundations were deeper than Six Hells [1].  
  
Then, with all of my strength,  
I broke the piles from the foundations,  
And kicked them down to Hell.  
  
From the source of the river, cool wind blowed, and clear water flowed.  
The salmon, who were weeping as they left,    
Revived in the cool wind and clear water.  
They laughed and played with great joy,  
And swam upstream with the sound of water splashing.  
Seeing this, my heart was comforted,    
And I returned along the river.  
  
The Little Okikirmui told his own tale.
