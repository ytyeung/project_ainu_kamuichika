| Translation 1 | 5 | 4 |  4.6 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 |  4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Pros: Accurate translation of the Ainu terms and their meanings. Cons: Some sentences are slightly awkward in their phrasing.

#### Translation 2
Pros: Concise and generally accurate. Cons: Some phrases are less natural-sounding compared to Translation 1.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 is slightly better because it maintains a more consistent and natural flow in its phrasing. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 1's sentence structures and word choices make it marginally easier to read and understand. For example, in section (2), Translation 1's "It is said that when you want to know a person's character, you can best understand it by looking at their eyes" is more natural than Translation 2's "It is said that when you want to understand a person's nature, the clearest thing to look at is their eyes."
