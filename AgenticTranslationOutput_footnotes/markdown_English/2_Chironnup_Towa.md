(1) isoeonkami.iso は海幸,eonkami は......を謝す事.
鯨が岸で打ち上げられるのは,海の大神様が人間に下さる為に御自分で持って来て,岸へ打ち上げて下さるものだと信じて,その時は必ず重立った人が盛装して沖の方をむいて礼拝をします.
(2) ononno.これは海に山に猟に出た人が何か獲物を持って帰って来た時にそれを迎える人が口々に言う言葉です.
(3) uniwente......大水害のあと,火災のあと,火山の破裂のあと,その他種々な天災のあったあとなどに,または人が熊に喰われたり,海や川に落ちたり,その他なにによらず変った事で負傷したり,死んだりした場合に行う儀式の事.
その時は槍や刀のさきを互いに突き合せながらお悔みの言葉を交します.一つの村に罹災者が出来ると,近所の村々から沢山の代表者がその村に集ってその儀式を行いますが,一人と一人でも致します.
(4) hokokse......uniwente の時,また大へんな変り事が出来た時に神様に救いを求める時の男の叫び声.フオホホーイと,これは男に限ります.
(5) ashur は変った話,ek は来る.
......村から遠い所に旅に出た人が病気したとか死んだとかした時にその所からその人の故郷へ使者がその変事を知らせに来るとか,外の村で誰々が死にましたとか,何々の変った事がありましたとかと村へ人が知らせに来る事を云います.
その使者を ashurkorkur(変った話を持つ人)と云います.
ashurkorkur は村の近くへ来た時に先ず大声をあげて hokokse(フオホホーイ)をします.すると,それをききつけた村人は,やはり大声で叫びながら村はずれまで出迎えてその変り事をききます.

(7) matrimimse(女の叫び声)......何か急変の場合または uniwente の場合,男は hokokse(フオホホーイ)と太い声を出しますが,女はほそくホーイと叫びます.
女の声は男の声よりも高く強くひびくので神々の耳にも先にはいると云います.それで急な変事が起った時には,男でも女の様にほそい声を出して,二声三声叫びます.
(8) peutanke......rimimse と同じ意ですが,これは普通よく用いられる言葉で,rimimse の方は少し難かしい言葉になっています.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) isoeonkami. iso means fishing, eonkami means thanking for something.
It is believed that when a whale is washed ashore, the Great God of the Sea brings it himself for humans and washes it ashore. At that time, important people dress up and worship facing the sea.
(2) ononno. This is what people say when someone returns from hunting in the mountains or at sea with prey.
(3) uniwente... A ritual performed after a major flood, fire, volcanic eruption, or other natural disaster, or when a person is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to some unusual event.
At that time, they exchange words of condolence while pointing the tips of spears and swords at each other. When a disaster victim appears in one village, many representatives from neighboring villages gather in that village to perform the ritual, but it can also be done by one person.
(4) hokokse... A man's cry for help from God during uniwente or when a terrible event occurs. It's "Hohohoi," and this is limited to men.
(5) ashur means a strange story, ek means to come.
...When someone who has traveled far from the village becomes ill or dies, a messenger comes from that place to inform the person's hometown of the incident, or when someone from another village comes to inform the village that someone has died or that something strange has happened.
That messenger is called ashurkorkur (a person with a strange story).
When ashurkorkur comes near the village, he first shouts loudly hokokse (Hohohoi). Then, the villagers who hear it also shout loudly and go out to the edge of the village to hear the strange story.
(6) uchishkar... Crying together. This is a woman's greeting, when they meet after a long separation, when a close relative dies, or when someone is in great danger and barely escapes, women hold hands or hug each other's heads or shoulders and cry.
(7) matrimimse (a woman's cry)... In the event of a sudden change or uniwente, men make a loud voice of hokokse (Hohohoi), but women cry in a thin voice, "Hoi."
It is said that women's voices are higher and stronger than men's voices, so they reach the ears of the gods first. Therefore, when a sudden change occurs, even men make a thin voice like a woman and shout two or three times.
(8) peutanke... It has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, and rimimse is a slightly difficult word.

This is the English Translation 2.
(1) isoeonkami.iso refers to the sea blessing, eonkami refers to... an apology. When a whale is washed ashore, it is believed that the sea god personally brought it and washed it ashore to give it to humans. Therefore, important figures will dress up and offer prayers facing the sea.
(2) ononno. These are the words spoken in unison by people welcoming those returning from hunting at sea or in the mountains with their prey.
(3) uniwente... A ritual held after a major flood, fire, volcanic eruption, or other natural disasters, or when someone is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies for any other reason. At that time, people would hold the tips of their spears or knives together and exchange words of condolence. If a village had victims, many representatives from nearby villages would gather in that village to hold a ceremony, even if there was only one person.
(4) hokokse... A man's cry for help from the gods during uniwente or when a major incident occurs. フオホホーイ, this is limited to men.
(5) ashur is news of an incident, ek is arrival. When someone traveling far from the village gets sick or dies, a messenger is sent from that place to the person's hometown to inform them of the incident, or someone from another village comes to inform them that so-and-so has died, or that something has happened, etc. This messenger is called ashurkorkur (the person who brings news of the incident). When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they will first shout hokokse (フオホホーイ) loudly. The villagers who hear the cry will also shout loudly and go to the edge of the village to greet them and ask about the incident.
(6) uchishkar... Crying together. This is a woman's greeting, when they meet again after a long separation, when a close relative dies, or when someone encounters a major danger and barely escapes, etc., women will hold hands or hug each other's heads or shoulders and cry.
(7) matrimimse (a woman's cry)... In the event of an emergency or uniwente, men will make a rough hokokse (フオホホーイ) sound, while women will call out in a soft voice, ホーイ. It is said that women's voices are higher and louder than men's voices, so the gods will hear them first. Therefore, in the event of an emergency, even men will make a subtle sound like women and shout two or three times.
(8) peutanke... Has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, while rimimse is a slightly more difficult word.
