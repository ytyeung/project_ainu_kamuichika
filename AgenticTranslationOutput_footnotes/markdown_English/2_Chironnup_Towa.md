(1) isoeonkami.iso は海幸,eonkami は......を謝す事.
鯨が岸で打ち上げられるのは,海の大神様が人間に下さる為に御自分で持って来て,岸へ打ち上げて下さるものだと信じて,その時は必ず重立った人が盛装して沖の方をむいて礼拝をします.
(2) ononno.これは海に山に猟に出た人が何か獲物を持って帰って来た時にそれを迎える人が口々に言う言葉です.
(3) uniwente......大水害のあと,火災のあと,火山の破裂のあと,その他種々な天災のあったあとなどに,または人が熊に喰われたり,海や川に落ちたり,その他なにによらず変った事で負傷したり,死んだりした場合に行う儀式の事.
その時は槍や刀のさきを互いに突き合せながらお悔みの言葉を交します.一つの村に罹災者が出来ると,近所の村々から沢山の代表者がその村に集ってその儀式を行いますが,一人と一人でも致します.
(4) hokokse......uniwente の時,また大へんな変り事が出来た時に神様に救いを求める時の男の叫び声.フオホホーイと,これは男に限ります.
(5) ashur は変った話,ek は来る.
......村から遠い所に旅に出た人が病気したとか死んだとかした時にその所からその人の故郷へ使者がその変事を知らせに来るとか,外の村で誰々が死にましたとか,何々の変った事がありましたとかと村へ人が知らせに来る事を云います.
その使者を ashurkorkur(変った話を持つ人)と云います.
ashurkorkur は村の近くへ来た時に先ず大声をあげて hokokse(フオホホーイ)をします.すると,それをききつけた村人は,やはり大声で叫びながら村はずれまで出迎えてその変り事をききます.
(6) uchishkar......泣き合う.これは女の挨拶,長く別れていて久しぶりで会った時,近親の者が死んだ時,誰かがなにか大変な危険にあって,やっと免れた時などに,女どうしで手を取り合ったり,頭や肩を抱き合ったりして泣く事.
(7) matrimimse(女の叫び声)......何か急変の場合または uniwente の場合,男は hokokse(フオホホーイ)と太い声を出しますが,女はほそくホーイと叫びます.
女の声は男の声よりも高く強くひびくので神々の耳にも先にはいると云います.それで急な変事が起った時には,男でも女の様にほそい声を出して,二声三声叫びます.
(8) peutanke......rimimse と同じ意ですが,これは普通よく用いられる言葉で,rimimse の方は少し難かしい言葉になっています.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) isoeonkami. iso means sea blessing, eonkami means... to thank for something.
It is believed that when a whale is washed ashore, the Great God of the Sea brings it himself for humans and washes it ashore. At that time, important people dress up and worship towards the sea.
(2) ononno. This is what people say when someone returns from hunting in the mountains or at sea with prey.
(3) uniwente... A ritual performed after a major flood, fire, volcanic eruption, or other natural disasters, or when someone is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to any unusual event.
At that time, they exchange words of condolence while pointing the tips of spears and swords at each other. When a disaster victim appears in one village, many representatives from neighboring villages gather in that village to perform the ritual, but it can also be done by one person.
(4) hokokse... A man's cry for help from God during uniwente or when a terrible event occurs. It's like "Hoo-hoo-hoi," and this is limited to men.
(5) ashur means a strange story, ek means to come.
...When someone who has traveled far from the village becomes ill or dies, a messenger comes from that place to inform their hometown of the incident, or when someone from another village comes to inform the village that someone has died or that something strange has happened.
That messenger is called ashurkorkur (a person with a strange story).
When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they first shout hokokse (Hoo-hoo-hoi) loudly. Then, the villagers who hear it also shout loudly and go out to the edge of the village to hear the strange story.
(6) uchishkar... Crying together. This is a woman's greeting, when they meet after a long separation, when a close relative dies, or when someone has been in great danger and barely escaped, women hold hands, hug each other's heads or shoulders, and cry.
(7) matrimimse (a woman's cry)... In case of a sudden change or uniwente, men make a loud voice like hokokse (Hoo-hoo-hoi), but women shout in a thin voice like "Hoo-ee."
It is said that women's voices are higher and stronger than men's voices, so they reach the ears of the gods first. Therefore, when a sudden event occurs, even men make a thin voice like a woman and shout two or three times.
(8) peutanke... It has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, and rimimse is a slightly difficult word.

This is the English Translation 2.
[1] isoeonkami.iso means sea blessing, eonkami means... apology. People believe that whale stranding is the sea god personally bringing and pushing them ashore as a gift to humans. At that time, respected people will dress up and worship in the direction of the sea.
[2] ononno. These are words often spoken by people welcoming those who go to sea or hunt in the mountains when they return with prey.
[3] uniwente... A ritual held after various natural disasters such as floods, fires, and volcanic eruptions, or when someone is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to other accidents. At that time, people will touch each other with guns or knife points and offer condolences. If a village has victims, neighboring villages will send many representatives to gather in the village to hold the ritual, even if there is only one person.
[4] hokokse... A male shout to the gods for help during uniwente or when a major incident occurs. The sound "フオホホーイ" is made, and is limited to men.
[5] ashur means a strange story, ek means arrival. ...Refers to when a person traveling from a place far from the village becomes ill or dies, and a messenger is sent from that place to inform their hometown of the incident, or when people from other villages come to inform someone of their death, or when some strange event has occurred. The messenger is called ashurkorkur (a person with a strange story). When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they will first shout hokokse (フオホホーイ) loudly. The villagers who hear the shout will also shout loudly and go to the edge of the village to meet the messenger and inquire about the incident.
[6] uchishkar... Crying together. This is a female greeting. When women reunite after a long absence, when a close relative dies, or when someone survives a major danger, women will hold hands or hug each other's heads or shoulders and cry.
[7] matrimimse (female shout)... In emergencies or uniwente situations, men will make a rough hokokse (フオホホーイ) sound, while women will make a subtle ホーイ sound. It is said that women's voices are higher and louder than men's, so the gods will hear them first. Therefore, in an emergency, even men will make a subtle sound like women and shout two or three times.
[8] peutanke... Has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, while rimimse is a slightly more difficult word.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand |  Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | 
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 |  4.4 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 |  4.6 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 provides a clear and understandable explanation of the Ainu chant footnotes. It effectively conveys the meaning of each term and the associated cultural practices. However, some nuances might be lost in the simplification.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is also well-done, with a slightly more precise rendering of certain terms and cultural contexts. The inclusion of the original Japanese sounds (フオホホーイ, ホーイ) adds authenticity. However, the overall readability is comparable to Translation 1.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is slightly better because it more accurately reflects the nuances of the original Japanese text, particularly in the descriptions of rituals and customs. For example, in (1), Translation 2 uses "apology" which is closer to the meaning of "謝す事" than "to thank for something" in Translation 1. Also, Translation 2 keeps the original sound "フオホホーイ" and "ホーイ" which is better than only translating them. While both translations are generally good, Translation 2's attention to detail gives it a slight edge.
