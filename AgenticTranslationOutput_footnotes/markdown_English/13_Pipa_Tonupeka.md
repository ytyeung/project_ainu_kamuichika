This is the Japanese text.
(1) kinatantuka......蒲の束.蒲は編んで筵の様な敷物にするのですが,よく乾いているのをそのまま編むといけませんから,少し湿してからつかいます.この話にあるのも,そのために女が川へ持って行くのでしょう.
(2) i-okapushpa.人は死んでしまった親や親類などの名を言ったり,その事をふだん話したりする事を i-okapushpa と言って大へん嫌います.また,人のかくしていた事をそばからほじり出して,みんなに言ったり,その人の聞きにくい様なその人の前の行為などを口に出したりする事をも i-okapushpa と言います.
(3) nimakitara......牙の剥き出している.これは犬の事.山のけものたちは,人が猟に行くと犬を連れて行きますが,その犬に歯をむき出してかかられるのが一ばん恐いので,犬にこんな名をつけて恐がっています.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) kinatantuka......A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into mats, but if you weave them when they are completely dry, it won't work, so you moisten them a little before using them. In this story, the woman is probably taking them to the river for that purpose.
(2) i-okapushpa. People greatly dislike saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or talking about them in everyday conversation, which is called i-okapushpa. Also, digging up things that people have hidden and telling everyone, or bringing up past actions of that person that are difficult for them to hear, is also called i-okapushpa.
(3) nimakitara......Bare fangs. This refers to a dog. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them, and they are most afraid of being attacked by a dog with its teeth bared, so they give the dog this name out of fear.

This is the English Translation 2.
(1) kinatantuka......Cattail bundle. Cattails are woven into mat-like pads, but dry cattails cannot be woven directly, so they must be slightly moistened before use. This is also mentioned in the story, which is why the woman brought it to the riverside.
(2) i-okapushpa. People are very taboo about saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or talking about them in ordinary times, which is called i-okapushpa. In addition, digging up other people's hidden things and telling everyone, or telling that person's embarrassing behavior in front of others, etc., is also called i-okapushpa.
(3) nimakitara......Baring fangs. This refers to dogs. When people go hunting for wild animals in the mountains, they bring dogs. Because being attacked by a dog with bared teeth is the most terrifying thing, they call dogs by this name to express fear.

### Comments

Translation 1 is generally accurate and reads well. The explanations are clear and easy to understand.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is also accurate, but some of the phrasing is a bit less natural and slightly more awkward compared to Translation 1.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 is slightly better because it uses more natural English phrasing and avoids some of the slightly awkward constructions found in Translation 2. While both are generally accurate, Translation 1's clarity gives it a slight edge.
