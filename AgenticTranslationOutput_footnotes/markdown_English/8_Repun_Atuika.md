(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).

This is the English Translation 1.
It is a decoration made with gohei, and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as a representative of humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei are called iku pashui (sake feast chopsticks).

This is the English Translation 2.
This is an object decorated with gohei, used to offer sacred sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as an agent of humans, conveying what humans want to say to the gods. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei decorations are called iku pashui (chopsticks for feasts).

| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 |  4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 |  4.6 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is straightforward and understandable, but some word choices are slightly less precise (e.g., "representative" instead of "agent").

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 uses slightly more precise language and reads more smoothly. The term "sacred sake" is a better translation of お神酒.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 uses slightly more precise language (e.g., "sacred sake," "agent") and flows a bit better. While both are understandable, Translation 2 edges out Translation 1 in clarity and accuracy.

This is an object decorated with gohei, used to offer sacred sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as an agent for humans, conveying what humans want to say to the gods. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei decorations are called iku pashui (chopsticks for sake feasts).
