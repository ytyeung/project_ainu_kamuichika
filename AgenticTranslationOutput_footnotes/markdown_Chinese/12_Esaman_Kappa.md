### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand |  Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | 
| Translation 1 | 5 | 5 |  5.0 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 |  4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is accurate and reads naturally. It maintains the original meaning well.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is also accurate but slightly less natural in its phrasing. The addition of 的 after 骯髒 is unnecessary and makes it slightly less direct.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Both translations are quite similar and accurate. Translation 1 is slightly better because it uses 「骯髒」 which is a more direct and common translation of "きたない" in this context compared to 「骯髒的」. Also, Translation 1 maintains better flow and sounds more natural in Chinese.

### Updated Output
```
