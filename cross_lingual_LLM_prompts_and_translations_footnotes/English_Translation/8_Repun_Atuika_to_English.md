(1) 以御幣裝飾之物,於向神明獻上神酒時使用。此 kike-ush-pashui 擔任人類的代理,據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui(酒宴用筷)。

```

### Output

This object, decorated with gohei, is used when offering sacred sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as a proxy for humans and is said to convey the messages that humans want to send to the gods. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei decorations are called iku pashui (chopsticks for feasts).
