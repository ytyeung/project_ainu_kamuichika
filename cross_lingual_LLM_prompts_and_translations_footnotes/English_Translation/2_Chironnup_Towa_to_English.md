(1) isoeonkami.iso 是海幸,eonkami 是......謝罪之意。
鯨魚擱淺在岸邊,是因為海神大人為了賜予人類,親自帶來並推上岸的,人們深信不疑,此時一定會由德高望重的人盛裝打扮,面向大海的方向進行禮拜。
(2) ononno. 這是出海或上山打獵的人,帶著獵物歸來時,迎接的人們異口同聲說出的話語。
(3) uniwente......大水災、火災、火山爆發等各種天災之後,或是有人被熊吃掉、落入海或河中,以及其他任何因變故而受傷或死亡的情況下所舉行的儀式。
屆時,人們會互相用槍或刀尖抵住對方,同時交換慰問之詞。一個村莊若有災民,鄰近村莊會派出許多代表聚集到該村莊舉行儀式,即使只有一個人也會舉行。
(4) hokokse......uniwente 時,或發生重大變故時,向神明祈求救助時男性的呼喊聲。フオホホーイ,僅限男性。
(5) ashur 是變故的消息,ek 是到來。
......從村莊遠方出外旅行的人,生病或死亡時,由該地派遣使者將變故告知其故鄉,或是從其他村莊有人來告知某某人過世了,或發生了某某變故等等,人們將這種情況稱為 ashur。
該使者被稱為 ashurkorkur(帶有變故消息的人)。
ashurkorkur 在靠近村莊時,首先會大聲呼喊 hokokse(フオホホーイ)。聽到呼喊聲的村民,也會大聲呼喊,並到村莊邊緣迎接,詢問變故的消息。
(6) uchishkar......互相哭泣。這是女性的寒暄方式,久別重逢時、近親過世時、有人遭遇重大危險好不容易脫險時等等,女性之間會手牽著手,或互相擁抱頭部或肩膀哭泣。
(7) matrimimse(女性的呼喊聲)......發生緊急情況或 uniwente 的情況時,男性會發出粗獷的 hokokse(フオホホーイ)聲,女性則會發出細微的ホーイ聲。
據說女性的聲音比男性的聲音更高亢響亮,因此能先傳入神明的耳中。因此,發生緊急變故時,即使是男性也會像女性一樣發出細微的聲音,呼喊兩三聲。
(8) peutanke......與 rimimse 相同的意思,但這是普通常用的詞彙,rimimse 則稍微是比較難的詞彙。

(1) isoeonkami.iso refers to good fortune from the sea, eonkami means apology or gratitude.
When a whale is beached, people firmly believe that the sea god brought it ashore as a gift to humans. At this time, a respected person will dress formally and offer prayers facing the sea.
(2) ononno. These are words spoken in unison by people welcoming hunters returning from the sea or mountains with their prey.
(3) uniwente... A ritual held after various natural disasters such as floods, fires, and volcanic eruptions, or in cases of accidental injury or death, such as someone being eaten by a bear or falling into the sea or river.
During the ritual, people point guns or knives at each other while exchanging words of condolence. If a village has suffered a disaster, representatives from neighboring villages will gather to hold the ritual, even if only one person is affected.
(4) hokokse... A male cry for help to the gods during uniwente or other major emergencies. フオホホーイ, exclusively for men.
(5) ashur refers to news of an incident, ek means arrival.
...When someone traveling far from the village becomes ill or dies, a messenger is sent to inform their home village. Or, when someone from another village comes to report a death or incident, this situation is called ashur.
The messenger is called ashurkorkur (the person carrying news of the incident).
When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they first shout hokokse (フオホホーイ). Hearing the shout, the villagers also shout loudly and go to the edge of the village to greet them and inquire about the news.
(6) uchishkar... Crying together. This is a form of greeting between women when they reunite after a long separation, when a close relative dies, or when someone narrowly escapes a dangerous situation. The women hold hands or embrace each other's heads or shoulders and cry.
(7) matrimimse (female cry)... In emergencies or during uniwente, men make a rough hokokse (フオホホーイ) sound, while women make a soft ホーイ sound.
It is said that women's voices are higher and louder than men's, so they can reach the gods' ears first. Therefore, in an emergency, even men will make a soft sound like women, shouting two or three times.
(8) peutanke... Has the same meaning as rimimse, but it is a more commonly used word. rimimse is a slightly more difficult word.
