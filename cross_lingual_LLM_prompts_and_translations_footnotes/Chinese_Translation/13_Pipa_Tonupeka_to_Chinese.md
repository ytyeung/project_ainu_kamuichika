### Prompt

Translate the following text from English to Chinese. The original text is translation from Japanese which is footnotes of Ainu chant. 
Keep the original meaning. Use modern Chinese. Display in Traditional Chinese. Only allow Chinese and English characters.
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.

(1) kinatantuka...... A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into mats and other coverings, but if you try to weave them when they are completely dry, it won't work well. So, they are slightly moistened before use. In this story, the woman is probably taking them to the river for that purpose.

(2) i-okapushpa. People greatly dislike saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in everyday conversation, which is called *i-okapushpa*. Also, digging up things that people have kept hidden and telling everyone, or bringing up past actions that are difficult for the person to hear, especially in front of them, is also called *i-okapushpa*.

(3) nimakitara...... Baring its fangs. This refers to a dog. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them, and being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most frightening thing. Therefore, they give dogs this kind of name out of fear.

```

### Output
```
(1) kinatantuka...... 一捆香蒲。香蒲被編織成墊子和其他覆蓋物，但如果試圖在它們完全乾燥時編織，效果不佳。因此，在使用前會稍微潤濕。在這個故事中，這位女子可能正將它們帶到河邊以達到這個目的。

(2) i-okapushpa。人們非常不喜歡說已故父母或親戚的名字，甚至在日常談話中談論他們，這被稱為 *i-okapushpa*。此外，挖掘人們隱藏的東西並告訴大家，或提出讓人難以聽到的過去行為，尤其是在他們面前，也被稱為 *i-okapushpa*。

(3) nimakitara...... 露出獠牙。 這裡指的是狗。 當人們去山裡打獵時，他們會帶狗，而被一隻露出牙齒的狗攻擊是最可怕的事情。 因此，他們出於恐懼而給狗起這種名字。
