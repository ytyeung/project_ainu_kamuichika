Translate the following text from English to Chinese. The original text is translation from Japanese which is footnotes of Ainu chant. 
Keep the original meaning. Use modern Chinese. Display in Traditional Chinese. Only allow Chinese and English characters.
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.

(1) pau: Onomatopoeia for the sound of a fox's cry.

(2) pushtotta: A bag-like item used when going sea hunting, to carry fire-making tools, medicines, and other small necessities. Similar items for the same purpose include *piuchiop* and *karop*, but these are made from cattail matting (*gama*) or *attush* woven fabric, so they are used on land. *pushtotta* are made from bear skin, seal skin, or other fur, making them waterproof and suitable for taking to sea.

(3) noya ai: Arrow made of mugwort. Mugwort is a plant revered by the Ainu. It is said that demons fear being struck by a mugwort arrow because it prevents them from floating away, making it an essential item for long journeys.

(4) Originally, men's and women's toilets were separate. *ashinru* and *eosineru* both refer to toilets.

Among foxes, the black fox is considered the most revered. Capes jutting out into the sea are generally considered the territory of black foxes, and it is said that a black fox will not make its presence known to humans unless something very serious is happening.

*Okikurumi (Okikirmui)*, *Samayunkur*, and *Shupunramka* are cousins, with *Shupunramka* being the oldest and *Okikirmui* the youngest. *Shupunramka* is a gentle and timid person, so there are no stories about him. *Samayunkur* is short-tempered, lacks wisdom, is hasty, has a bad nature, and is a coward. *Okikirmui*, on the other hand, is wise like a god, compassionate, courageous, and a great person, so there are countless stories about him.

```

### Output
```
（1）pau：狐狸叫聲的擬聲詞。

（2）pushtotta：一種出海狩獵時使用的袋狀物品，用於攜帶生火工具、藥品和其他小型必需品。用於相同目的的類似物品包括*piuchiop*和*karop*，但這些是用香蒲蓆（*gama*）或*attush*編織物製成的，因此它們在陸地上使用。*pushtotta*由熊皮、海豹皮或其他毛皮製成，使其具有防水性，適合帶到海上。

（3）noya ai：用艾草製成的箭。艾草是阿伊努人崇敬的植物。據說惡魔害怕被艾草箭擊中，因為它會阻止它們漂走，使其成為長途旅行的必需品。

（4）最初，男女廁所是分開的。*ashinru*和*eosineru*都指廁所。

在狐狸中，黑狐被認為是最受尊敬的。突出到海中的海角通常被認為是黑狐的領地，據說除非發生非常嚴重的事情，否則黑狐不會讓人們知道它的存在。

*Okikurumi (Okikirmui)*、*Samayunkur*和*Shupunramka*是堂兄弟，其中*Shupunramka*年紀最大，*Okikirmui*年紀最小。*Shupunramka*是一個溫柔而膽小的人，所以沒有關於他的故事。*Samayunkur*脾氣暴躁、缺乏智慧、很草率、本性不好，而且是個懦夫。另一方面，*Okikirmui*像神一樣聰明、富有同情心、勇敢，是個偉人，所以有數不清關於他的故事。
