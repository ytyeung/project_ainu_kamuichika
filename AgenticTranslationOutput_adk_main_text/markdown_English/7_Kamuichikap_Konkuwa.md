The Owl God's Own Song
         "Konkuwa"

"Konkuwa,
In the past, when I spoke, it was like the sound of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark,
resonating through the center of the bow.
But now, I have weakened and grown old.
However, if there were someone eloquent and
confident as a messenger,
I would like to send them to Heaven with a mission worth five and a half."
As I said this, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
someone at the entrance said,
"Who else but me is eloquent and
confident as a messenger?"
Looking, it was a young crow.
I let him in, and then, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
I told the young crow the details of the mission,
Three days passed, and as I was explaining the third point,
I saw the young crow dozing off by the hearth.
Seeing this, I was irritated and
slapped the young crow with his wings and killed him.
Then again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
"If there is anyone confident as a messenger,
I would like to send them to Heaven with a mission worth five and a half."
As I said this, someone again at the entrance said,
"Who else but me is eloquent enough to
stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
Looking, it was a jay from the mountains.
I let him into the house, and then again,
tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
I explained the mission worth five and a half.
Four days passed, and as I was explaining the fourth task,
the jay from the mountains was dozing off by the hearth.
I became angry and slapped the jay from the mountains with his wings and
killed him.
Then again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would like to send them to Heaven
with a mission worth five and a half."
As I said this, someone
came in with a respectful attitude, and looking, it was
a young river crow, beautiful in appearance,
who sat on the left seat. So I,
tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
continued to explain the five and a half tasks
day and night. Looking,
the young river crow showed no sign of fatigue
and listened, and on the sixth day,
as I finished speaking, he immediately went out
through the skylight and went to Heaven.
The gist of the mission was that in the human world,
there was a famine and the humans were on the verge of
starvation. The reason for this was that in Heaven,
the god who controls the deer and the god who controls the fish
had consulted and decided not to send deer or fish.
No matter what was said to them, they pretended not to know,
so when the humans went to the mountains to hunt,
there were no deer, and when they went to the river to fish,
there were no fish.
I was angry when I saw this, so
I sent a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.
After many days,
a faint sound was heard in the sky,
and someone came in. Looking, it was
the young river crow, now more beautiful than before,
adorned with brave dignity,
who began to state the counter-argument.
The reason why the deer god and the fish god of Heaven
had not sent deer or fish until today
was that when humans caught deer,
they hit the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,
they left the deer's head as it was in the mountains.
When they caught fish,
they killed them by hitting their heads with rotten wood,
so the deer, crying naked,
returned to the deer god, and the fish
returned to the fish god with rotten wood in their mouths. The deer god and the fish god
were angry and consulted, and did not send deer
or fish. But if from now on
humans treat deer and fish
with care, they will send deer
and fish, the deer god and
the fish god said in detail.
After hearing that, I presented
praise to the young river crow, and looking, it was true
that the humans had treated deer and fish
carelessly.
From then on, I taught the humans in their dreams
not to do such things again, and the humans
realized that they were wrong, and from then on,
they made beautiful tools for catching fish, like *nusa*,
and used them to catch fish. When they caught a deer, they also
decorated the deer's head beautifully and worshiped it, so
the fish were happy and carried beautiful *gohei* in their mouths
to the fish god, and the deer
were happy and returned to the deer god with newly shaved *sakayaki*. The deer god and
the fish god were pleased and
sent many fish and many deer.
The humans are now living without any trouble
or hunger.
I was relieved to see that.
I am old and weak,
so I was thinking of going to Heaven,
but I could not go without caring that there was
a famine in the human country that I protect and the humans were starving,
so I have stayed until now, but now I have
no worries, so I will place the strongest
young hero after me to protect the human world,
and now I am going to Heaven."
So, the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the country,
told the story and went to Heaven.

The Owl God's Own Sung Ballad
         "Konkwa"

"Konkwa,
In the past, when I spoke, it was like the bowstring of a cherry bark-wrapped bow,
Resonating from the center of the bow's grip,
I spoke,
But now I am weakened and old.
However, if there is someone eloquent,
Confident as a messenger,
I would like to send them to heaven for a five-and-a-half negotiation."
While tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
I said, when someone at the entrance said,
"Who but I is eloquent as a messenger
And full of confidence?"
Looking, it was a young crow.
I invited him into the house, and then, while tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
To appoint the young crow as a messenger,
I explained the details of the negotiation, and after three days,
While speaking about the third negotiation point, I saw
The young crow dozing off by the hearth, and seeing this,
I was enraged and beat the young crow,
Feathers and all, and killed him.
Then again, while tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
"If there is someone confident as a messenger,
I would like to send them to heaven for a five-and-a-half
Negotiation," I said,
When someone again at the entrance said,
"Who but I is so eloquent,
Enough to stand as a messenger to heaven?"
Looking, it was a jay.
I invited him into the house, and then again,
While tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
Speaking about the five-and-a-half negotiation,
After four days, while speaking about the fourth point,
The jay was dozing off by the hearth.
I was very angry and beat the jay, feathers and all,
And killed him.
Then again, while tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
"If there is someone eloquent, confident as a messenger,
I would like to have them take the five-and-a-half negotiation to heaven,"
I said, when someone
Approached with a respectful attitude, and looking,
It was a young dipper, handsome,
Sitting in the left seat. So I,
While tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
Continued to speak about the
Five-and-a-half important matters, night and day. Looking at
The young dipper, without any sign of fatigue,
Listening, counting the days and nights,
On the sixth day,
As soon as I finished speaking, he immediately went out through the skylight
And went to heaven.
The gist of that negotiation was that in the human world,
There was a famine and the humans were on the verge of
Starving to death. Investigating the reason,
It turned out that in heaven,
The god who governs deer and the god who governs fish
Had consulted and decided not to release deer or fish,
So no matter how much the humans pleaded, they pretended not to know,
So the humans went hunting
In the mountains, but there were no deer, and went fishing
In the rivers, but there were no fish.
I was angry when I saw this,
So I dispatched a messenger to the deer god and the fish god
To negotiate.
After several days,
A faint sound was heard from the sky,
And someone came in. Looking,
It was the young dipper, now even more beautiful than before,
Endowed with a heroic spirit,
And began to state the return negotiation.
The reason why the deer god and the fish god of heaven
Had not released deer or fish until today
Was that when humans caught deer,
They hit the deer's head with wood, and after skinning it,
They discarded the deer's head as it was in the mountain forest,
And when they caught fish,
They killed them by hitting their heads with rotten wood,
So the deer, naked and crying,
Returned to the deer god's side, and the fish
Returned to the fish god's
Side, holding rotten wood in their mouths. The deer god and the fish god
Were angry and consulted, and decided not to release deer or
Fish. But if from now on
The humans treat deer and fish
With care, then they will release deer
And release fish, the deer god and
The fish god said, he stated in detail.
After hearing that, I presented praise to the young dipper,
And saw that indeed
The humans treated deer and fish
Crudely.
From then on, in order to prevent such things from happening again,
I taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,
And the humans also
Realized that they were wrong, and from then on,
They made fishing tools as beautifully as making幣,
And used them to catch fish. When they caught deer, they also decorated the deer's head
Beautifully and performed rituals, so
The fish happily held the beautiful gohei in their mouths
And went to the fish god, and the deer
Happily combed their new sakayaki and returned to the deer god.
The deer god and
The fish god were very happy,
And released a lot of fish, and released a lot of deer.
The humans now have no difficulties,
No hunger, and live happily,
I was relieved to see this.
I am old, weakened,
So I was going to go to heaven,
But I could not go without concern because there was a famine in the human country that I was protecting and the humans were about to starve to death,
So I have been here until now, but now I have
No worries, so I will leave the strongest
Young warrior behind me to protect the human world,
And today I am going to heaven."
And so, the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the country,
Told the story and went to heaven.
