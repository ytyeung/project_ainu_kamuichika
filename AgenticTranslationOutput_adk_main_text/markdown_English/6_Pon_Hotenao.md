The Song Sung by the Wolf God Himself
"Hotenao"

Hotenao
One day, feeling bored, I went to the beach,
While playing, a small man came.
When I went down the river, he also went down the river,
When I came up the river, he also went up the river, blocking my way.
Then, after going down the river six times
And up the river six times, the small man,
Showing his inherent irritation on his face, said,
"Pii pii,
You little brat, you bad little brat, if you do such a thing,
Tell me the old and current names of this cape."
I listened and said with a laugh,
"Who doesn't know the old and current names of this cape!
In the past, because there were noble and great gods and humans,
This cape was called God's Cape,
But now that the times have declined,
it is called Gohei Cape!"
Upon saying that, the small man said,
"Piiton, piiton,
You little brat, if you really know, then
Tell me the former and current names of this river."
Listening to this, I said,
"Who doesn't know the former name
And current name of this river!
In the old, great times, this river
Was called the River with a Swift Current,
But now that the world is declining, it is called the River with a Slow Current."
Upon saying that, the small man said,
"Piitonton, piitonton,
If you really say such things,
Let's reveal each other's true identities."
Listening to this, I said,
"Who doesn't know your true identity!
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting lodge, when he made a hearth frame of hazel wood,
That hearth frame dried out completely after being exposed to the fire.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
Rose up, and Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
Then that hearth frame floated along the current
And went out to sea, the gods watched
How it was struck by the waves of the distant sea and the waves of this sea,
And because it was a waste that an object made by the hands of the revered and great Okikirmui
Was drifting aimlessly and rotting with the seawater without being of any use,
the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And it was named Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish doesn't know its own identity,
So it disguises itself as a person and wanders around.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you."
Upon saying that, the small man's complexion
Changed as he listened,
"Piitonton, piitonton!
You are a small wolf child."
As soon as he finished speaking, he jumped into the sea with a splash.
Looking after him, a single red fish
Moved its tail fin and went far offshore.
So, the young wolf god told the story.
```
#### Comments
Pros: Clear and understandable language. Accurately conveys the story's events and dialogue.
Cons: The language is somewhat plain and lacks the poetic rhythm expected of a chant. Some phrases could be more evocative to capture the original tone.

The song sung by the little wolf god himself
"Hotenao"

Hotenao
One day, feeling bored, I went to the beach,
While playing, a little man came,
As I went down the river,
He also went down the river with me,
When I went up the river, he also went up the river with me, blocking my way.
Then, after going down the river six times,
And up the river six times, the little man
Finally showed his inherent impatience on his face and said,
"Pii pii,
You little brat, bad little brat, if you keep doing that,
Then tell me,
the old name and the current name of this cape."
I listened and said with a smile,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the
current name of this cape!
In the past, because noble and great gods and humans lived here,
This cape was called the Cape of Gods,
But now that the times have declined,
It is called the Cape of Gohei!"
After I finished speaking, the little man said,
"Piiton, piiton,
You little brat, if you are really that good,
Then tell me the old name and the current name of this river."
Listening to this, I replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the
current name of this river!
In the past, in that great era, this river was called
The River of Rapid Flow,
But now that the world is declining, it is called the River of Slow Flow."
After I finished speaking, the little man said,
"Piitonton, piitonton,
If you are really that good,
Let's reveal each other's true identities."
Listening to this, I replied,
"Who doesn't know your true identity!
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
To build a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame out of hazel wood,
That hearth frame was dried out by the fire.
When Okikirmui stepped on one end, the other end
Would rise, and Okikirmui was annoyed by this,
So he took that hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
After that, the hearth frame floated along the river,
Out to the sea, and the gods saw it being beaten by the distant sea waves and the nearby sea waves,
Thinking that something handmade by the venerable and great Okikirmui was
Wandering and flowing uselessly like that, rotting away with the seawater, it was
Too wasteful, so the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And named it Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, because it didn't know its own origins,
Transformed into a human and wandered around.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you."
After I finished speaking, the little man's face
Changed drastically,
"Piitonton, piitonton!
You are a small, wolf cub,
Ah."
As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately jumped into the sea with a splash.
I watched him go, and saw a red fish
Wagging its tail fin, swimming far away
Into the distance.
So, the young wolf god narrated.

#### Comments
Pros: Maintains a good narrative flow and accurately translates the story. The dialogue is well-represented.
Cons: Similar to Translation 1, it lacks a strong poetic element. The word choices are functional but not particularly evocative or rhythmic.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Both translations are quite similar in quality. They both accurately convey the story and are easy to understand. Neither stands out significantly in terms of poetic flow. Choosing Translation 1 because the title is slightly better.

One day, feeling bored, I wandered to the beach,
While playing, a small man appeared.
As I went down the river, he also went down the river with me,
