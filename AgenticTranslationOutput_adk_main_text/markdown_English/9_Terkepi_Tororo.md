The Frog's Own Song
"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"

Toro ro hanroku hanroku!
"One day, as I was hopping and playing around the meadow,
I saw a house, so I went to the doorway,
And inside the house, beside a pile of treasures,
There was a raised platform. On that platform,
A young man was carving a sheath, looking down.
I thought I'd play a trick, so I sat on the threshold
And sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
But the young man raised the hand holding his knife,
Looked at me, and smiled gently,
"Is that your song? Your song of joy?
I'd like to hear more."
So I happily sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
Then the young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I'd like to hear it closer."
Hearing that, I was delighted and hopped down to the lower seat,
Onto the edge of the hearth,
And sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
The young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I'd like to hear it closer."
Hearing that, I was truly happy, and hopped to the corner
Of the upper seat, by the hearth,
And sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
Suddenly! The young man leaped up,
And as I looked up, he grabbed a large burning log
And threw it at me. The sound was like
The front of my body was blocked off, and after that,
I didn't know what happened.
When I came to, I was at
The end of the garbage dump, a bloated frog
Was lying dead, and I was sitting between its ears.
Looking closely, I realized that the house
I thought was just a human's house was actually the house of Okikirmui,
A god of great power. And without knowing it was
Okikirmui, I had played a trick.
Now I am dying such a meaningless, bad death,
So from now on,
Frogs, never play tricks on humans."
So spoke the bloated frog as it died.

#### Comments
The translation is mostly accurate and understandable, but some parts are a bit literal. The poetic flow is decent but could be improved.

The frog sings its own song:
"Toro ro Hanroku Hanroku!"

Toro ro Hanroku Hanroku!
"One day, as I was hopping and playing in the meadow,
I saw a house, so I went to the doorway.
Looking inside, on the side where treasures were piled high,
there was a raised platform. On that platform
sat a young man, carving a sheath, his head bowed.
I thought I would play a trick on him, so I sat on the threshold,
and called out, "Toro ro Hanroku Hanroku!"
Unexpectedly, the young man raised the hand holding the knife,
looked at me, and smiled slightly,
saying, "Is that your song? Is that your joyful singing?
I would love to hear more." So, I happily
called out, "Toro ro Hanroku Hanroku!"
But the young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Is that your sakehau?
I would love to hear it from closer by."
I was delighted to hear this, so I hopped down to the
fireside,
calling out, "Toro ro Hanroku Hanroku!"
But the young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Is that your sakehau?
I would love to hear it from closer by." Hearing this,
I was truly happy, so I hopped to the corner of the
fireside on the upper seat,
calling out, "Toro ro Hanroku Hanroku!"
Suddenly! The young man stood up abruptly,
as if flying, picked up a large piece of burning firewood,
and threw it at me. I felt
darkness before my eyes, and then
I knew nothing more.
Waking up with a start,
I saw at the end of the garbage heap, a frog with a swollen belly
lying dead, and I was sitting between its ears.
Looking closely, what I thought was just an ordinary house,
was actually the home of Okikirmui, one as powerful as a god,
and
I had played a trick on him without even knowing he was Okikirmui.
Now I am going to die such a pointless death, such a miserable death,
so, frogs of the future,
never, ever play tricks on humans."
So said the swollen frog, and then it died.
