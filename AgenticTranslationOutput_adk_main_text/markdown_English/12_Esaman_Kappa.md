The otter sang this song himself:
"Kappa Reureu Kappa"

Kappa Reureu Kappa
One day, while playing along the stream,
I swam down to Samayunkuru's
water-drawing place,
When Samayunkuru's younger sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Came with a bucket in one hand and
a bundle of reeds in the other,
I put only my head out of the river's edge, and said,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The girl was surprised and looked around,
And when she found me, she showed anger on her face
And said,
"Oh, hateful flathead, bad flathead is
Making fun of people. Dogs, here..."
Then the big dogs
Ran out and bared their fangs when they saw me.
I was so surprised that I dove to the bottom of the river
And immediately escaped downstream through the riverbed.
Then, I put only my head out
at the mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing place,
And when I saw Okikirmui's younger sister
Beautiful as a goddess, with a bucket in one hand
And a bundle of reeds in the other,
I said,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The girl was surprised and looked around,
And when she found me, she showed anger on her face
And said,
"Oh, hateful flathead, bad flathead is
Making fun of people. Dogs, here..."
Then the big dogs ran out.
Seeing that, I remembered what had happened before
And while thinking it was funny, I dove to the bottom of the river
To escape, but
I never thought the dogs would do such a thing,
They bared their fangs and
Jumped at me to the bottom of the river,
Dragged me ashore, and bit and tore at
My head and my body, and in the end
I didn't know what happened.
When I came to my senses,
I was sitting between the big otter's ears.
I knew that Samayunkuru and Okikirmui
had neither father nor mother, so I played
such a prank and was punished,
Killed by Okikirmui's dogs,
I died a meaningless death, a bad death.
Otters from now on, never play pranks.
So, the otter told the story.

The Otter's Own Song
"Kappa Rewrew Kappa"

Kappa Rewrew Kappa
One day, as I frolicked along the stream,
Swimming downstream, I came to Samayunkur's
Water-drawing place.
Samayunkur's sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Holding a bucket in one hand and
A bundle of cattails in the other,
I poked my head out of the water,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?" I asked,
The maiden startled, her eyes darting about,
Upon spotting me, a look of anger
Appeared on her face,
"Ah, you detestable flathead, you wicked flathead,
Daring to mock me! Dogs, sic 'em!"
Before she finished speaking, several large dogs
Rushed out, baring their fangs at me.
Startled, I dove to the river bottom
And immediately fled along the riverbed.

Later, at Okikirimui's water-drawing place,
I poked my head out
And saw Okikirimui's sister,
Beautiful as a goddess, holding a bucket in one hand
A bundle of cattails in the other,
So I asked:
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden startled, her eyes darting about,
Upon spotting me, anger
Appeared on her face,
"Ah, you detestable flathead, you wicked flathead,
Daring to mock me! Dogs, sic 'em!"
Before she finished speaking, several large dogs rushed out.

Seeing this, I recalled the previous incident
And, finding it amusing, was about to dive to the river bottom
To escape,
Never expecting the dogs to do such a thing,
They bared their fangs
And leaped into the river after me,
Hauled me ashore, my head and body
Bitten and gnawed upon, until
I no longer knew what was happening.

Suddenly regaining consciousness,
I was sitting
Between the ears of a large otter.

I knew that Samayunkur and Okikirimui
Had neither father nor mother,
And I was punished for my mischief,
Killed by Okikirimui's dogs,
Meeting a pointless death, a wretched death.

Otters of the future, never play pranks again.
So, the otter narrated.
```
#### Comments
Pros: Accurate translation, good readability, maintains a poetic tone. Cons: 'the otter narrated' sounds a bit weird.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Both translations are very good and achieve similar scores. Translation 2 is slightly preferred because 'So, the otter narrated.' sounds more natural than 'So, the otter told the story.'
