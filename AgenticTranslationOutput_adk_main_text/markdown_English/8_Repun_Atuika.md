The Sea God Himself Sang: "Atoika Tomatoma ki Kuntoteashi Humu Humu!"

Atoika Tomatoma ki Kuntoteashi Humu Humu
My eldest brother, six brothers, my eldest sister, six sisters,
My younger brother, six brothers, my younger sister, six sisters,
Were raising me, but I,
Built a raised platform beside the pile of treasures, and on that platform
Sat carving sheaths, engraving sheaths,
Doing only that,
As my life's work. Every day, when morning came, my brothers
Shouldered their quivers and went out with my sisters,
And when evening came, they returned with tired faces,
Empty-handed, and my sisters,
Though tired, prepared the meals, set a tray before me,
Ate their own meals, and when the dishes were cleared away,
Then my brothers busily set to making arrows.
When the quivers were full, they were all so tired
They would sleep, snoring loudly.
The next day, while it was still dark,
Everyone would get up, my sisters would prepare the meals and set a tray before me,
And when everyone had eaten, they would shoulder their quivers again
And go out. Again, in the evening,
They would return with tired faces, empty-handed,
My sisters would prepare the meals, my brothers would make arrows,
Always doing the same thing.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters
Shouldered their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but presently
I rose on the raised platform, took a golden bow
And a golden arrow, and went outside.
I saw the sea was wide and calm,
And whales were playing, splashing,
To the east of the sea, to the west of the sea. Then,
To the east of the sea, my eldest sister, six sisters, joined hands and made a circle,
My younger sister, six sisters, drove the whales into the circle,
My eldest brother, six brothers, my younger brother, six brothers,
Aimed and shot at the whales in the circle, and the arrows
Passed beneath the whales, passed above them.
Every day they did this sort of thing.
I saw in the center of the sea
A large whale and its calf playing, splashing,
Up and down, so from a distant place
I notched a golden arrow to my golden bow
And aimed and shot, piercing both whale and calf
At once with a single arrow.
Then I cut the whale in half
And threw half of it into my sisters' circle.
Then, with one and a half whales
Under its tail, I went toward the land of humans,
Arrived at Otasutsu Village,
And pushed the one and a half whales
Up onto the village beach.
Then I swam slowly back
Over the sea, when someone
Came running breathlessly beside me,
And I saw it was the sea grebe.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Brave God, Great God,
Why have you given such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes
And sickles to cut and poke and
Whittle away at the great sea bounty. Brave God,
Great God, please quickly
Take back the great sea bounty. Even though you give them so much sea bounty,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not feel grateful and do such things."
So I laughed and said,
"I gave it to the humans,
So now it is theirs. If the humans
Poke at their possessions with sickles or
Whittle them away with axes, isn't it all right
For them to eat as they please?
What's wrong with that?" Then
The sea grebe looked disconsolate,
But I paid it no mind and swam slowly
Over the sea, and
As the day was growing dark, I arrived at my sea.
I saw
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, unable to carry
Their half of the whale, all struggling together,
Making slow progress to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.
I paid them no mind and went home
And sat on the raised platform.
Then, looking back toward the human world,
I saw fine men and
Fine women, in full dress, surrounding
The one and a half whales I had beached,
Rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty, and on the dunes behind,
Fine mats were spread,
And on them the village chief of Otasutsu Village,
With six robes and a bundled sash, wearing six robes,
And wearing a fine divine crown, an ancestral crown,
On his head, and wearing a divinely granted sword at his waist,
In a godlike and beautiful manner, raised his hands high
And was worshipping. The humans were crying
And rejoicing over the sea bounty.
What the grebe had said about the humans
Poking at the whale I had beached with
Axes and sickles was not true;
the village chief and
The villagers were taking out
The divine sword, which they had long considered
The most precious of treasures,
And using it to cut the meat and carry it away.
Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something
Seemed to appear in the window, so
I turned and looked, and on the window
Was a golden cup, filled to overflowing
With sake, and on it
Were sacred chopsticks with gohei attached,
Going back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am a person from Otasutsu Village,
And with great reverence, I offer you sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu Village,
Representing all the villagers,
spoke in detail of the circumstances in which he offered his thanks to me,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Great God, if not for you, Brave God,
Who would have pitied our village, where there was a famine
And we were so desperately
Lacking in food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing over the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake,
Added a small nusa,
And offer our thanks to the Great God."
This was what
The gohei-adorned chopsticks declared, going back and forth.
So I rose, took
The golden cup, and raised it to my forehead,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Poured a little fine sake into each,
And placed the golden cup on the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the raised platform
And saw that the cup had disappeared, along with the chopsticks.
Then, carving sheaths
And engraving sheaths, presently
I raised my face and saw
That the house was full of beautiful gohei,
And the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning
Was flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then again, two or three days passed,
And at last, outside the house,
I heard my brothers and
Sisters pulling the whale,
Shouting loudly. I was amazed.
As I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces
Withered. When everyone had entered and saw the many gohei,
They were surprised and worshipped many times over.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of the gods' favorite
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful gohei,
Invited the gods of distant places and the gods of nearby places,
And held a grand banquet. My sisters
Boiled the whale and offered it to the gods,
And the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I rose
And told in detail how there had been a famine in the human world
And, feeling pity, I had beached the sea bounty,
And how, when I had done good to the humans, the evil gods
Were jealous of it, and the sea grebe had slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu Village
Had taken those words and offered his thanks to me,
And how the gohei-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy,
And the gods
All nodded in unison,
Praising me.
Then again, we held a grand banquet,
And the sounds of the gods
Dancing and leaping here and there
Made a beautiful sound, and my sisters
Carried the choshi and went around pouring sake between the seats,
And sang in beautiful voices with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the banquet closed.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,
And the gods bent low at the waist
And bowed many times over,
And all returned to their own homes.
After that, as always, my eldest brother, six brothers,
My eldest sister, six sisters, my younger sister, six sisters,
My younger brother, six brothers, were with me,
And whenever the humans made sake,
They would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.
Now the humans have no lack of food
And live in peace, without any troubles,
So I am at ease.

The song the Sea God himself sang, "Atoika Tomatomaiki Kuntoteashi Humu Humu!"

Atoika Tomatomaiki Kuntoteashi Humu Humu
Eldest brother, six brothers, eldest sister, six sisters
Younger brother, six brothers, younger sister, six sisters
Were raising me, and I,
Beside the pile of treasures, built a high platform, and on that platform
Sat carving scabbards,
Doing only that,
And living my days.
Every day, in the morning, the brothers
Would carry their quivers and go out with the sisters,
And in the evening, with tired faces,
Return empty-handed, and the sisters,
Though also tired, would prepare the meals, set the table for me,
Eat themselves, and after the meal was cleaned up,
Then the brothers would busily make arrows.
When the quivers were full, everyone was tired,
And when they slept, they would snore loudly and fall asleep.
The next day, while it was still dark,
Everyone would wake up, the sisters would prepare the meals, set the table for me,
And after everyone had eaten, they would carry their quivers again
And leave. And in the evening again,
With tired faces, they would return empty-handed,
The sisters would prepare the meals, the brothers would make arrows,
Always doing the same things.
One day, again, the brothers and sisters
Carried their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but soon
Rose from the high platform, took the golden bow
And golden arrows and went outside,
And saw that the sea was vast and calm,
And whales were playing with splashes
To the east and west of the sea. Then,
To the east of the sea, the eldest sister, six sisters, joined hands and made a circle,
The younger sister, six sisters, drove the whales into the circle,
The eldest brother, six brothers, the younger brother, six brothers
Aimed at the whales in the circle and shot arrows, and the arrows
Passed under the whales and passed over them.
Every day they were doing these things.
Looking, I saw in the center of the sea
A large whale and its baby whale playing with splashes
Up and down, so
From a distance, I notched a golden arrow to the golden bow
Aimed and shot, and with one arrow
Pierced both the parent and baby whale at once.
So I cut the middle of one whale,
And threw half of it into the sisters' circle.
Then, putting one and a half whales
Under my tail, I headed towards the land of humans
And arrived at Otashutsu Village,
And pushed one and a half whales
Onto the village beach.
Then, leisurely on the sea,
I swam back,
When someone
Came running by, panting,
And I saw it was the sea spirit.
Panting, it said:
"Tomin karikuru kamui karikuru isoyankekuru
Brave god, great god,
Why did you give such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, with axes
And sickles, are cutting, poking,
And scraping away at the great sea bounty, brave god,
Great god, please quickly take back
the great sea bounty. Even if you give them so much sea bounty,
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, do not feel grateful and do such things."
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Since I have given it to the humans,
It is now their property, so whether the humans
Poke at their possessions with sickles or
Scrape them with axes,
They are free to eat them as they please,
So what?"
The sea spirit was somewhat disconcerted,
But I didn't care at all, and on the sea
I swam leisurely,
And as the sun was about to set, I arrived at my sea.
I saw that
Twelve brothers, twelve
sisters, could not carry that half whale,
And everyone was shouting loudly,
Moving slowly to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.
I ignored them and went home,
And sat on the high platform.
Then, looking back at the human world,
I saw that around the one and a
half whales that I had pushed up, splendid men and
splendid women were gathered in full dress,
Joyfully dancing and rejoicing at the sea bounty, and on the dunes behind,
Splendid mats were spread,
And on them, the village chief of Otashutsu Village
Was wearing six kimonos, with a belt tied, wearing six kimonos
Over his shoulders, with a splendid god's crown, an ancestral crown,
On his head, and a divinely granted sword at his waist,
Looking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high
And worshiping. The humans were crying
And rejoicing at the sea bounty.
The sea spirit said that the humans
Were poking at the whale I had pushed up with axes and sickles,
But the villagers,
Starting with the village chief,
Took out the divine sword, which they had always considered their most precious treasure,
And were cutting the meat with it and carrying it away.
And also, my brothers and sisters showed no signs of returning.
Two or three days passed, and then, towards the window,
Something seemed to be there, so
I turned around and saw that on the window
A golden cup was overflowing
With sake, and on top of it
Were sake chopsticks with gohei attached,
Moving back and forth, stating their message as envoys:
"I am from Otashutsu Village,
And though it is a great honor, I offer this sake."
The village chief of Otashutsu Village, representing
All the villagers, explained in detail the circumstances of expressing their gratitude to me,
"Tomin karikuru kamui karikuru isoyankekuru
If not for the great god, the brave god,
Who would have pity on our village, which is suffering from famine
And is in such a desperate situation
That we are extremely short of food?
You have given life to our village,
We are truly grateful, we rejoice in the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake,
And we offer a small gohei as a token of our gratitude
to the great god."
The sake chopsticks with gohei attached moved back and forth, stating their message.
So I got up, took the golden cup,
Held it high above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Poured in a little fine sake,
And placed the golden cup on the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the high platform
And saw that the cup had disappeared along with the chopsticks. Then, carving scabbards,
Carving scabbards, and then
Suddenly looking up,
The house was full of beautiful gohei,
And the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning
Was flashing. I thought, ah, how beautiful.
Then again, two or three days passed,
And then finally, outside the house, the brothers and
sisters were shouting loudly,
And I began to hear them pulling the whale. I was amazed.
Looking at them entering the house,
The brothers and sisters
Were very tired, and their faces were pale.
When everyone had come in, they saw so many gohei,
And were surprised and bowed many times.
Before long, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of sake,
beloved by the gods, filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful gohei,
Invited the gods of distant places and the gods of nearby places
And held a grand banquet. The sisters
Boiled whale meat and offered it to the gods,
And the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I stood up
And explained in detail how there was a famine in the human world,
And how I felt pity and pushed up the sea bounty,
And how when I treated the humans well, the evil gods
Were jealous of it, and the sea spirit slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otashutsu Village
Spoke those words and expressed his gratitude to me,
And how the sake chopsticks with gohei attached came as envoys, etc.
The gods
All nodded in unison,
Praising me.
Then again, a grand banquet was held,
And the sounds of the gods
Dancing and leaping there and here
Made beautiful sounds, and the sisters
Sometimes went around the seats with a sake pourer,
And sometimes sang with the goddesses
In beautiful voices.
Two or three days passed, and the banquet ended.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,
And the gods bent their waists
And bowed many times,
And everyone returned to their own homes.
After that, always together with the eldest brother, six brothers,
The eldest sister, six sisters, the younger sister, six sisters,
The younger brother, six brothers,
Whenever the humans made sake,
They would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.
Now, the humans no longer lack food,
Nor do they have any difficulties, and they live
Peacefully, so I am at peace.

Then I cut the whale in half
And threw half of it into my sisters' circle.
Then, with one and a half whales
Under its tail, I went toward the land of humans,
Arrived at Otasutsu Village,
And pushed the one and a half whales
Up onto the village beach.
Then I swam slowly back
Over the sea, when someone
Came running breathlessly beside me,
And I saw it was the sea grebe.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Brave God, Great God,
Why have you given such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes
And sickles to cut and poke and
Whittle away at the great sea bounty. Brave God,
Great God, please quickly
Take back the great sea bounty. Even though you give them so much sea bounty,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not feel grateful and do such things."
So I laughed and said,
"I gave it to the humans,

I saw fine men and
Fine women, in full dress, surrounding

Splendid mats were spread,
And on them the village chief of Otasutsu Village

And wearing a fine divine crown, an ancestral crown,
On his head, and a divinely granted sword at his waist,
Looking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high
And worshipping. The humans were crying
And rejoicing over the sea bounty.
What the grebe had said about the humans
Poking at the whale I had beached with
Axes and sickles was not true;

The villagers were taking out
