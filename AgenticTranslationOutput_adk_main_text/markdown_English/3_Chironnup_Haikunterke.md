The Fox's Own Song
"Hai Kunteleke Hai Koshitemutori"

Hai Kunteleke Hai Koshitemutori
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I was seated.
One day, I went outside to see,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon the sea,
Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur
Were out hunting, three in a boat. Seeing this,
The evil in my heart began to stir.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down,
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about.
In a heavy tone, as if snapping wood into pieces, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
And glared at the source of this river, summoning
the demon of the storm. Then, in response, from the source
of this river, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
burst forth and entered the sea, and immediately
this sea, the upper sea became the lower,
and the lower sea became the upper. Okikirmui and the others'
fishing boat, at the meeting place of the sea of the people offshore and the sea of the people on land (mid-sea),
encountered a sudden change and spun around in the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed over the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown away like a flying leaf,
and was about to capsize,
but admirably, the humans were strong
and this small boat glided through the wind,
upon the waves.
Seeing this, the evil in my heart began to stir.
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
and in a heavy tone, as if snapping wood into pieces, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
Devoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, finally, Samayunkur's
hands bled from above and below,
and he collapsed in exhaustion.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, exerting myself,
with light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
and in a heavy tone, as if snapping wood into pieces, I cried,
cheering on the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka, the two of them,
encouraging each other, bravely rowed the boat,
but then, at one point, Shupunramka's
hands bled from above and below,
and he collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps and a supple waist,
I leaped about, and in a heavy tone, as if snapping hard wood
into pieces, I cried, exerting myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a thin cloth wrapped around his body,
he rowed the boat, until
the oar he held in his hand broke.
Then, he leaped upon the exhausted and dying Samayunkur,
snatched the oar he held, and rowed the boat alone.
Seeing this, the evil in my heart began to stir.
In a heavy tone, as if snapping hard wood into pieces, I cried,
with light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
exerting myself to cheer on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, Samayunkur's rudder also
broke. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramka,
took his oar,
and bravely rowed the boat.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
still in the boat, in the fierce wind,
never imagining that he, a human, would find me,
he gazed into the center of my eyes,
upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His face, which had been gentle until now, showed anger,
and he fiddled with his bag,
and took out a small mugwort bow
and a small mugwort arrow.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
"What can humans do? Is there anything to fear?
What could he possibly do with such a mugwort arrow?"
Thinking this, upon this cape,
the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
up and down, up and down, with light steps
and a supple waist, I ran about, and in a heavy tone,
as if snapping hard wood into pieces, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
praising the demon of the storm.
In the midst of this, the arrow shot by Okikirmui came flying,
and pierced me right at the collar.
After that, I didn't know what happened.
When I came to,
the weather was very fine, and the sea was
vast, and there was no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
to the tip of my toes, it hurt as if the bark was burning and shrinking.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human would torment me so,
and then, writhing in agony,
upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
up and down, up and down, crying and screaming,
writhing in agony, living and
dying, day and night, I didn't know
what had happened.
When I came to,
I was between the ears of a large black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui came in the guise of a god,
and said with a smile,
"How beautiful! The black fox god who watches over
the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
had a good heart, a godly heart,
so he died a beautiful death."
Saying this, he took my head,
and took it to his house, using the bone of my upper jaw
as the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
as the cornerstone of his wife's toilet,
and my body rotted away with the earth.
Then, night and day,
suffering from a foul odor, I died a meaningless death, a bad
death.
I was not just a god of low status,
but because I had a terrible evil heart, I died a useless, bad death,
so from now on, you foxes, never
hold evil in your hearts.

So the fox god told the story.

#### Comments
Pros: Accurately conveys the original meaning and maintains a storytelling tone. The language is generally clear and understandable.
Cons: Some phrases are a bit literal, which impacts the poetic flow. For example, 'the evil in my heart began to stir' is repeated multiple times and sounds a bit plain.

The Fox's Own Ballad
"HA IKUNTEREKE HA IKOSHITEMUTORI"

HA IKUNTEREKE HA IKOSHITEMUTORI
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat.
One day, I ventured out to gaze,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunramuka, and Samayunkuru,
Set out in a boat, three of them, for a sea hunt. Seeing this,
The wicked thoughts within me stirred.
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I ran to and fro, up and down,
With light steps and a supple waist.
In a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, "Pa-u, pa-u!"
Glaring at the source of this river, I summoned the magic of the storm.
Then, from the source of this river,
A fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Rose and entered the sea, and immediately,
This sea was overturned, the sea above became the sea below,
The sea below became the sea above. Okikirmui and his companions'
fishing boat, at the meeting place of the offshore sea and the inshore sea
(the middle of the sea), encountered a sudden upheaval, spinning
Amidst the waves. A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed down upon the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkuru, Shupunramuka,
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown about like a falling leaf,
On the verge of capsizing, but,
Admirable, the humans were strong,
And the small boat glided
Through the wind, upon the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred again.
I ran to and fro with light steps and a supple waist,
In a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, "Pa-u, pa-u!"
Devoting all my energy to cheering on the magic of the storm.
As this continued, finally, Samayunkuru's
hands, both above and below, bled,
And he collapsed in exhaustion.
Seeing his state, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I exerted myself,
Running to and fro with light steps and a supple waist,
Crying in a heavy tone, like snapping wood,
Cheering on the magic of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramuka,
Encouraged each other and bravely rowed the boat,
But then, Shupunramuka's
hands, both above and below, bled,
And he collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps and a supple waist,
I leaped about, crying in a heavy tone, like snapping hard wood,
Exerting all my energy.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
Clad in a thin garment,
He rowed the boat, and before long,
The oar in his hand snapped.
Then, he lunged at the exhausted and fallen Samayunkuru,
Seized the oar in his hand, and alone,
Rowed the boat.
Seeing this, the inherent wickedness within me stirred again.
Crying in a heavy tone, like snapping hard wood,
Running to and fro with light steps and a supple waist,
I exerted all my energy to cheer on the magic of the storm.
As this continued, Samayunkuru's rudder also
Snapped. Okikirmui lunged at Shupunramuka,
Seized his oar,
And bravely rowed the boat.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the fierce wind,
Never imagining that he, a human, could find me, he gazed at
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Above, at the center of my eyes.
His face, once gentle, now showed anger,
He fiddled with his bag,
And from it, he took out a small bow made of mugwort and
A small arrow made of mugwort.
Seeing these, I secretly smiled.
"Is there anything a human can do that is frightening?
What use is such a mugwort arrow?"
Thinking this, upon this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I ran to and fro, up and down, with light steps,
With a supple waist, crying in a heavy tone,
Like snapping hard wood, "Pa-u, pa-u!"
Praising the magic of the storm.
Just then, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
And pierced the nape of my neck.
From then on, I knew nothing more.
When I suddenly came to my senses,
The weather was very fine, and the sea was
Vast, and there was no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.
For some reason, from the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it ached as if Daphne bark was burning and shrinking.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human would torment me so,
And then I struggled, writhing in agony,
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, crying out,
Struggling in agony, half-alive day and night, and before I knew it,
I knew nothing more.
When I suddenly came to my senses,
I was between the ears of a large black fox.
About two days later, Okikirmui came in the guise of a god,
Smiling and saying,
"How beautiful, the black fox god who watches over the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Because he possessed a good heart, a god's heart,
His death is so peaceful."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jawbone
As the cornerstone of his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
From then on, day and night,
I suffered from the foul odor, and I died a meaningless, bad
Death.
I was not just a god of low status,
But because I had such a terribly wicked heart, I died a
Useless, bad death,
So, foxes of the future, never
Hold wicked thoughts.

So the fox god narrated.
