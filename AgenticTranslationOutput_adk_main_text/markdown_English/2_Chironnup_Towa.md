The Fox's Self-Sung Song: "Towatowato"

Towatowato,
One day, I went to the seaside to gather food.
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
As I went, I looked ahead and saw
A whale had washed ashore on the beach.
Humans were all dressed in finery,
Rejoicing in the sea's bounty, dancing in the sea's bounty,
Some cutting the meat, others carrying it,
Important people offering thanks and prayers for the sea's bounty,
Some sharpening knives—the beach was black with them.
Seeing this, I was greatly pleased.
"Ah, I must hurry and get there,
I want to receive even a little bit," I thought,
And shouting, "Banzai! Banzai!"
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I went closer and closer, but when I arrived,
Contrary to all expectations,
What I thought was a whale washed ashore
Was just a dog's toilet on the beach,
A large mountain of dung.
That is what I had mistaken for a whale.
What I thought were humans rejoicing in the sea's bounty, dancing in the sea's bounty,
Cutting and carrying the meat,
Were just crows
Pecking at the dung, scattering the dung,
Flying this way and that.
I was furious.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
Running from the seaside,
I looked ahead and saw
A boat, and in that boat
Two humans were exchanging condolences.
"Oh, what sudden event
Has caused them to do such a thing? Perhaps
Someone has capsized with the boat,
Ah, I must hurry closer
And hear what they are saying."
Thinking this, I shouted loudly, "Hohohoi!"
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and went to see,
But what I thought was a boat was just
A rock on the beach, and what I thought were people
Were just two large cormorants.
I saw the two large cormorants stretching and shrinking their long necks
As if they were exchanging condolences.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and went up the river,
And far upstream
Two women were standing in the shallows, weeping together.
Seeing this, I was startled.
"Oh, what bad thing has happened,
What ill omen has come that they are weeping so?
Ah, I must hurry and arrive
And hear what they are saying."
Thinking this,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and went to see,
But in the middle of the river were two fish weirs,
And the stakes of the two weirs were being hit by the current and shaking,
And I thought the two women were looking up and down at them and
Weeping together.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
Then again, going up the river,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips,
I flew as if on wings and came back.
I looked ahead and saw
That for some reason
My house was ablaze,
The smoke rising into the sky
Like gathering clouds. Seeing this, I
Was so startled I nearly fainted.
Shouting in a woman's voice,
I jumped up, and from the other side someone
Shouted loudly, "Hoi!" and flew to my side.
It was my wife, with a startled look on her face, breathless,
"Husband, what is wrong?" she said, and I saw
That what looked like a fire
Was just my house as it always was.
No fire, no smoke.
It was just that my wife was hulling grain,
And at that moment the wind blew strongly, and the winnowed millet
Chaff was being blown away,
And I saw it as smoke.
I went out to find food but found none, and on top of that
I shouted so loudly that my wife
Was startled and threw away the millet she was winnowing
Along with the chaff,
So we have nothing to eat tonight.
I was furious and threw myself onto the floor
And went to sleep.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,
You dim-eyed, wicked wretch,
You stinky thing beneath the tail,
You rotten thing beneath the tail,
You whose rear oozes resin,
You whose rear drips filthy water,
What a way to see things!"
So
The fox head narrated.

#### Comments
The translation accurately conveys the original meaning and is easy to understand. The poetic flow is also well-preserved. The use of 'Banzai' is a good choice.

The fox himself sang the song "Towatwato"

Towatwato
One day, I went to the beach to pick up food.
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
As I walked, looking at where I was going,
I saw a whale stranded on the beach.
The people were all dressed up,
Joyfully celebrating the bounty of the sea, joyfully dancing,
People cutting meat and carrying it back and forth,
Important people thanking and worshiping the bounty of the sea,
People sharpening knives, etc., a black mass on the beach.
I was very happy to see that.
"Ah, I want to get there quickly,
I want to get even a little bit," I thought,
While shouting, "Hurray! Hurray!"
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
I went on and on, and when I got close,
It was completely unexpected.
I thought a whale had washed ashore,
But there was a dog toilet on the beach,
A huge mountain of dung,
I thought it was a whale.
I thought the people were joyfully dancing and celebrating the bounty of the sea,
Cutting and carrying meat,
But it was the crows
Pecking at the dung, scattering it everywhere,
Flying this way and that.
I was very angry.
"You dull-eyed, useless fellow,
You dull-eyed, bad fellow,
You smelly thing under the tail,
You rotten thing under the tail,
You thing with resin coming out of your butt,
You thing with dirty water coming out of your butt,
What kind of way of looking at things is that!"
Then again,
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
Running from the beach,
I saw on my way
A boat, and in the boat two people
Mourning each other.
"Oh, what kind of emergency
Is causing them to do that? Perhaps
Someone capsized with the boat?
Ah, I want to get closer quickly,
I want to hear what people are saying."
Thinking that, I shouted "Hoo-hoo-ee!"
In a loud voice,
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
I ran as if flying, and when I looked,
What I thought was a boat was a rock
On the beach, and what I thought were people
Were two huge pelicans.
The two huge pelicans were stretching and shortening their long necks,
And I saw them as mourning each other.
"You dull-eyed, useless fellow,
You dull-eyed, bad fellow,
You smelly thing under the tail,
You rotten thing under the tail,
You thing with resin coming out of your butt,
You thing with dirty water coming out of your butt,
What kind of way of looking at things is that!"
Then again,
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
I ran upstream as if flying,
And I saw two women far upstream
Standing in the shallows, crying together.
I was surprised to see that,
"Oh, what bad thing has happened,
What bad news has come that they are crying so much?
Ah, I want to get there quickly and hear what people
Are saying."
Thinking that,
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
I ran as if flying, and when I looked,
In the middle of the river, there were two fish weirs,
The piles of the two fish weirs were being hit by the current and shaking,
And I thought the two women were bowing and looking up
And crying together.
"You dull-eyed, useless fellow,
You dull-eyed, bad fellow,
You smelly thing under the tail,
You rotten thing under the tail,
You thing with resin coming out of your butt,
You thing with dirty water coming out of your butt,
What kind of way of looking at things is that!"
Then again, going up the river,
Scratching in the stones
Scratching in the wood chips
I came back as if flying.
I looked at where I was going
And for some reason,
My house was burning,
The smoke rising into the sky
Was like piled up clouds. When I saw that, I
Was so surprised that I almost lost consciousness.
I screamed in a woman's voice
And jumped up, and someone from the other side
Shouted "Hey!" in a loud voice and ran
To my side. When I looked, it was my wife,
With a surprised look on her face, panting,
"What's wrong, dear?"
She said, and when I looked,
What looked like a fire,
My house was standing there as it was.
No fire, no smoke.
It was when my wife was milling,
At that time, the wind was blowing strongly, and the winnowed millet
Bran was being blown away,
And I saw it as smoke.
I went out to look for food, but I couldn't find any, and on top of that,
I shouted loudly again, and my wife
Was so surprised by my shout that she threw the millet she was winnowing
Away with the winnowing basket,
So we won't be able to eat anything tonight.
I was so angry that I threw myself under the bed
And fell asleep.
"You dull-eyed, useless fellow,
You dull-eyed, bad fellow,
You smelly thing under the tail,
You rotten thing under the tail,
You thing with resin coming out of your butt,
You thing with dirty water coming out of your butt,
What kind of way of looking at things is that!"
So
The fox chief told the story.

#### Comments
The translation conveys the original meaning and is easy to understand. However, the poetic flow is not as well-preserved as in Translation 1. The use of 'Hurray' is less impactful than 'Banzai'.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 is better because it is translated directly from Japanese, which helps to preserve the original nuance and poetic flow more effectively. The choice of 'Banzai' also adds a layer of cultural context that is missing in Translation 2.
