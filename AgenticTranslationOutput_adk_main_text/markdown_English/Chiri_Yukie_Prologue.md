Prologue

Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Like innocent children, they lived leisurely and happily embraced by the beautiful nature. They were truly the darlings of nature, how fortunate they were.
In the winter, they hunted bears, kicking through the deep snow covering the forests and traversing mountains without being deterred by the freezing cold. In the summer, they fished all day long in the green waves where cool breezes swam, with the songs of white gulls as their companions, floating in small boats like leaves. In the blooming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, singing and living with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterbur and mugwort. In the autumn of colorful leaves, they parted the pampas grass with ripening ears in the autumn breeze, the bonfires for catching salmon disappearing until late at night, and tied dreams to the round moon, with the sounds of deer calling their friends in the valleys. Ah, what a joyful life it was. A peaceful realm, but now it is a thing of the past. Dreams have been shattered for decades, and this land has undergone rapid changes, with mountains and fields turning into villages, and villages gradually developing into towns.
The natural scenery of ancient times has faded away unnoticed, and the whereabouts of many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains are also unknown. We, the few remaining members of our tribe, can only stare in astonishment at the ways of the advancing world. Moreover, the beautiful soul of the people of the past, who were controlled by religious ideas in every action, has been lost from those eyes, filled with anxiety and burning with discontent, dulled and darkened, unable to see the way forward, and forced to rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, the dying ones... that is our current name, what a sad name we have.
In the past, our happy ancestors could not have imagined even in the slightest that their homeland would eventually change into such a miserable state.
Time flows constantly, and the world progresses infinitely. Even from among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of defeat in the fierce arena of competition, someday, if even two or three strong ones emerge, the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our earnest desire, something we pray for day and night.
But... will the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other in their daily lives, the many beautiful words that have been told, left behind, and passed down, all disappear fruitlessly along with the dying weak? Oh, that is too painful and regrettable.
Born as an Ainu and raised in the Ainu language, I have written down in my clumsy writing one or two of the very small stories from the various tales that our ancestors gathered and enjoyed on rainy evenings and snowy nights, whenever I had free time.
If many people who know us can read this, I will feel truly infinite joy and supreme happiness together with our fellow ancestors.

Prologue

In the old days, this vast Hokkaido was our ancestors' free land. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. They were truly nature's darlings, such fortunate people.
In winter, on land, they kicked away the thick snow covering the forests, defying the freezing cold, crossing mountains to hunt bears. In summer, at sea, they were accompanied by cool breezes, rippling green waves, and the songs of white gulls, floating on leaf-like boats, fishing all day long. In the flower-blooming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending time with the eternally singing birds, picking butterburs and mugwort. In the autumn of fiery red leaves, they parted the pampas grass, its ears aligned by the wind, until the bonfires for salmon fishing extinguished late into the night, dreaming under the round moon amidst the deer's calls echoing in the valleys. Ah, what a joyful life! A peaceful realm, now a thing of the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone rapid transformations, with mountains and fields becoming villages, and villages becoming towns, gradually developing.
The natural scenery of ancient times has faded into obscurity, and the whereabouts of the many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains are unknown. We, the remaining members of our tribe, can only widen our eyes in astonishment at the advancing world. Moreover, from those eyes, the beautiful light of the souls of the people of old, who were governed in every action by religious ideas, has disappeared, filled with unease, burning with discontent, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, things that are dying... that is our name now, what a sad name we bear.
In the old days, our happy ancestors could not have imagined even a little that their homeland would eventually become such a miserable sight.
Time flows continuously, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of defeat in the fierce arena of competition, someday, if two or three strong people emerge, the day will come when we can walk alongside the advancing world. That is our earnest wish, something we pray for day and night.
But... will the many languages that our beloved ancestors used in their daily lives to communicate with each other, the many beautiful words passed down and left behind, will those things also disappear mercilessly, along with the dying weak? Oh, that is too sad and regrettable.
Born into the Ainu tribe and raised in the Ainu language, I gather whenever I have free time on rainy nights and snowy nights, recording with clumsy strokes a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors.
If many people who understand us can read these, I will feel truly infinite joy and supreme happiness, together with our ancestors.
