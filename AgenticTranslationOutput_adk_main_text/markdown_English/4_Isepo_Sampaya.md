The Hare's Own Song: "Sanpaya Tereke"

Sanpaya Tereke
Leaping over two valleys, leaping over three,
I followed my brother to the mountains, playing along the way.
Every day I went after my brother,
And when I saw that humans had set up a crossbow trap, my brother
Would break it. I always laughed at this.
But on this day, when I went again,
Unexpectedly,
My brother was caught in the crossbow, crying out.
I was shocked and flew to my brother's side.
My brother, crying, said,
"Listen, little brother, now you must
Run and go behind our village.
Then shout loudly, 'Brother is caught in a crossbow! Hohohoi!'"
I listened and replied,
"Yes, yes," and then,
Leaping over two valleys, leaping over three,
I came playing along,
And arrived behind our village.
There, I finally remembered that my brother had sent me on an errand.
I tried to raise a shout,
But I had completely forgotten what my brother had told me to say.
I stood there trying to remember, but it was no use.
Then again,
Leaping over two valleys, leaping over three,
I hopped and skipped backwards
To where my brother was,
But no one was there.
Only my brother's blood was splattered around.
(Here the story digresses)
Ketoka, woi woi, ketoka, ketoka, woi ketoka.
Every day I went to the mountains
And destroyed the crossbows that humans had set up,
Always finding it amusing.
But one day, at the usual place, a crossbow was set up,
And beside it was a small mugwort crossbow.
When I saw it,
I thought,
"What is this thing for?"
And finding it funny,
I touched it a little. I tried to run away immediately,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in that crossbow, more than I wanted to be.
The more I struggled to escape,
The tighter it squeezed, and I couldn't do anything.
I was crying,
And something flew to my side.
When I looked, it was my younger brother.
I was delighted and told him to inform our clan of this,
But no sound came, no matter how long I waited.
As I was crying, a shadow
Appeared beside me. When I looked,
A human youth, beautiful like a god,
Smiling, took me
And carried me somewhere. I saw that
The inside of a large house was filled with divine treasures.
That youth lit a fire,
Put a large pot over the fire, drew a hanging sword,
Cut my body into small pieces, skin and all,
Filled the pot, and then thrust my head under the pot,
And started stoking the fire. I wanted to
Escape somehow, so I watched for an opening
In the human youth's attention, but the human youth never took
His eyes off me.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked,
I will have to die a meaningless, bad death."
Thinking this, I watched for the human youth's
Carelessness, and finally,
I transformed myself into a piece of meat
Mixed my body with the rising steam, climbed onto the edge of the pot,
Jumped down to the left side, and immediately
Fled outside, crying.
I flew, panting, and came
To my house,
Relieved that it had been a truly dangerous situation.
Looking back,
I realized that the one I had thought was just a human, just a youth,
Was Okikirmui, a god-like powerful being.
Okikirmui was very angry that I had thought it was just a crossbow set up by a human
And played pranks every day, and tried to kill me with a small mugwort crossbow,
But I, too, was not just a god of low status, and if I had a meaningless, bad death,
My relatives would be troubled and confused.
He took pity on me and
Thanks to that, he didn't chase after me even when I escaped.
Since then, hares
Used to be as big as deer,
But because of the pranks I played,
I became as small as one of Okikirmui's meat pieces.
From now on, all of our companions will be about this size.
From now on, hares, never play pranks."
So, the hare chief taught his children and died.

#### Comments
The translation is mostly accurate and understandable, but some parts are a bit literal and lack poetic flow. The choice of 'hare' instead of 'rabbit' is a stylistic one that may not resonate with all readers.

The Rabbit's Own Song, "Sanpaya Tereke"

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys, then three,
I hopped along, playing,
Following my brother to the mountains.
Each day I went after my brother,
And saw humans setting up crossbows.
My brother would break those crossbows,
And I would always laugh at him.
Then one day,
When I went again,
Never could I have imagined,
My brother caught in a crossbow, crying out.
Startled, I flew to his side,
And my brother said, weeping:
"Oh, little brother, now,
You must run back,
To the back of our village,
And shout loudly: Brother is caught in a crossbow—, Hoo ooh hoo ee."
I listened,
"Hi, hi," I replied, and then,
Across two valleys, then three,
Playing as I came,
To the back of our village.
There I finally remembered what my brother had sent me to do,
I wanted to shout loudly,
But, what did my brother say he sent me to do?
I had completely forgotten. I stood there, frozen,
Trying to remember, but I couldn't.
Then again,
Across two valleys, then three,
Hopping backwards, leaping backwards,
I came to where my brother was,
But no one was there.
Only my brother's blood was everywhere.
(Here the story jumps elsewhere)
Ketoka woivoi ketoka, ketoka woi ketoka
Every day I went to the mountains,
Destroying the crossbows set up by humans,
Always finding it amusing,
Then one day, I came to the usual place and found a crossbow set up,
And beside it, a small mugwort crossbow was set up.
When I saw that,
I thought: "What's the use of such a thing?"
Finding it laughable,
I touched it slightly, wanting to escape immediately,
But never could I have imagined,
That I would be caught so tightly
In that crossbow.
The more I struggled to escape,
The tighter it clamped, and I could do nothing,
I wept.
Then, something
Flew to my side, and when I looked, it was my little brother.
Pleased, I told him to inform our people of this,
But after waiting a long time, there was no news.
I wept, and then, beside me,
A shadow of a person appeared. When I looked,
A human youth, beautiful as a god,
Smiling, seized me,
And took me somewhere. When I looked,
A huge house was filled with divine treasures.
That youth lit a fire,
Placed a large pot over the fire, drew a hanging sword,
Cut my body, skin and all, into small pieces,
Filled the pot, then stuck his head under the pot,
Stoking the fire.
Wishing somehow
To escape, I watched for an opening from the human youth,
But the human youth never took his eyes off me.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked, I will have to
Die a meaningless death, a bad death."
Thinking this, I watched for the human youth's carelessness,
Watching and watching, finally,
I transformed myself into a piece of meat,
Mixed into the rising steam, climbed to the edge of the pot,
Jumped down to the left seat, and immediately
Leapt outside, crying,
Flying, panting, I fled,
Arriving at my home,
It was truly dangerous, I sighed in relief.
Looking back,
What I had thought was just a human, just a youth,
Was Okikirmui, a being as strong as a god.
What I had thought were just crossbows set up by humans,
Okikirmui was very angry that I played pranks on them every day,
And tried to kill me with a small mugwort crossbow, but I,
Am not just a god of low status, if I were to suffer a meaningless death, a bad death,
My relatives would also be troubled and confused.
He pitied me,
And so, he did not chase after me even when I fled.
Since then, before,
Rabbits had bodies as large as deer,
But because I played such pranks,
I became as small as one piece of Okikirmui's meat.
From now on, our companions will all become this size.
From now on, rabbits, never play pranks again.
So, the rabbit chief taught the children and died.
