### Translation 1
```
The clam itself sang the song "Tonupeka Ranran"

Tonupeka Ranran
The intense sunlight has dried up the place where I am,
and I feel like I'm about to die.
"Someone, please give us water to drink,
please help us. Water, water!" we cried out.
Then, from the direction of the beach, a woman came,
carrying a basket on her back.
As we were crying, she passed by us,
and when she saw us, she said,
"Strange clams, bad clams, what are you crying about,
making such a noisy fuss?"
She stepped on us, kicked us with her toes, crushed us with our shells,
and went far away into the mountains.
"Oh, it hurts, it's painful, water, water!" we cried out.
Then, from the direction of the beach, another woman came,
carrying a basket on her back. We cried,
"Someone, please give us water to drink and help us,
oh, it hurts, oh, it's painful, water, water!"
Then, the young woman, with a divine and beautiful noble air,
came to my side, and when she saw us, she said,
"Oh, you poor things, it's very hot, and the clams'
beds have dried up, and they want water.
What happened?
It looks like you've been trampled on..." she said,
collecting us all and putting us in butterbur leaves,
and putting us in a beautiful lake.
We completely recovered our energy with the clear, cold water,
and became very strong. Then, for the first time,
I investigated the nature of those women,
and it turned out that the hateful woman who came first and crushed me,
the bad woman, was Samayunkuru's
younger sister, and the young woman who pitied us
and helped us, the gentle and graceful one,
was Okikirmui's younger sister.
Samayunkuru's sister, being evil and hateful,
dried up her millet field, and Okikirmui's
sister made her millet field bear much fruit.
That year, Okikirmui's sister harvested a great deal.
Knowing that it was because of me,
she harvested the millet ears with clam shells.
Since then, every year, human women
have come to use clam shells when harvesting millet ears.
So, one clam told the story.

The song of the swamp clam, sung by itself: "Tonupeka Ranran"

Tonupeka Ranran
The intense sunlight has dried up the place where I live,
and I feel like I'm about to die.
"Someone, please give us water to drink,
please help us. Water, water!" we cried out,
when from the distant shore, a woman came,
carrying a basket on her back.
As we cried, she passed by us,
and seeing us, said:
"Strange swamp clams, nasty swamp clams, what are you crying about,
making such a noisy fuss?" Saying so,
she trampled on us, kicked us with her toes, crushed us along with our shells,
and went straight into the mountains.
"Oh, it hurts, it's painful, water, water!" we cried out,
when from the distant shore, another woman came,
carrying a basket on her back. We
"Someone, please give us water to drink and help us,
oh, it hurts, oh, it's painful, water, water!" we cried and wailed.
Then, the young woman, with a divine, beautiful, and noble air,
came to our side and seeing us,
said, "Oh, how pitiful, it's so hot and the swamp clams'
beds have dried up, and they want to drink water,
what happened?
It looks like they've been trampled on..." Saying so,
she picked us all up, placed us on butterbur leaves,
and put us in a clear lake.
We completely recovered our energy with the clear, cold water,
and became very healthy. So, we began
to investigate their natures,
and found that the hateful woman who came first and crushed me,
the bad woman, was Samayunkur's
sister, and the gentle and quiet young woman who pitied us
and helped us was Okikirmuy's sister.
Because Samayunkur's sister was wicked,
she caused her millet field to wither, while Okikirmuy's
sister made her millet field bear fruit well.
That year, Okikirmuy's sister had a very large harvest.
Knowing that this was because of me,
she used swamp clam shells to pick the millet ears.
Since then, every year, human women
have come to use swamp clam shells when picking millet ears.
So, one swamp clam narrated.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Both translations are of high quality and achieve similar scores. I chose Translation 2 because the title is more descriptive and the word choice is slightly better, such as 'nasty swamp clams' instead of 'bad clams'.
