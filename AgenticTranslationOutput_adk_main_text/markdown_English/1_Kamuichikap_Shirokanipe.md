The Owl God's Own Song
"Silver drops fall, fall around me"

While singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I descended along the stream, and as I passed over the human village, I looked down and saw that the poor of old had become rich, and the rich of old had become poor.
On the beach, human children were playing with toy bows and arrows.
Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," as I passed over the children, they ran beneath me, saying,
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Come, shoot the bird with arrows!
The one who hits the god's bird first is the true hero, the true strong one!"
As they said this, the children of those who were once poor but now rich nocked golden arrows to golden bows and shot at me, but I dodged the golden arrows, passing above and below them.
Among them, one child joined the group with only a plain (wooden) bow and arrow. When I saw him, I could tell by his clothes that he was the child of a poor man. However, looking closely at his eyes, he seemed to be a descendant of a great person, an odd one joining the group. As he aimed at me with his plain bow and arrow,
the children of those who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,
"How funny, the child of a poor man!
That bird, the god's bird, won't even take our golden arrows, so why would it ever take your plain, rotten wooden arrow?"
And they kicked and hit the poor child. But the poor child paid no attention and kept aiming at me.
Seeing this, I felt very sorry for him.
Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I slowly drew circles in the sky. The poor child stood with one foot far and one foot near, biting his lower lip, aiming and shooting with a whoosh. The small arrow flew beautifully towards me, so I reached out and took the small arrow.
Spinning around and around, I cut through the wind and descended.
Then, the children ran, kicking up sandstorms as they raced.
The moment I fell to the ground, the poor child rushed to me first and took me.
Then, the children of those who were once poor but now rich ran up from behind,
cursing twenty or thirty times, pushing and hitting the poor child,
"Hateful child, child of a poor man!
You preempted what we were going to do!"
Then, the poor child covered me, pressing me firmly against his stomach.
Struggling and struggling, he finally jumped out of the crowd and ran away.
The children of those who were once poor but now rich threw stones and pieces of wood at him,
but the poor child paid no attention and ran, kicking up sandstorms, to the front of a hut. The child
put me through the first window, adding words to it, telling the story of what had happened.
From inside the house, an old couple came out, shading their eyes with their hands.
They were very poor, but they possessed the grace of a gentleman and a lady.
When they saw me, they bent deeply at the waist and were surprised.
The old man straightened his belt and bowed to me,
"Owl God, Great God,
Thank you for coming to our poor, humble home.
We were once wealthy enough to count ourselves among the rich,
but now we have become such insignificant poor people. It is presumptuous to have the country's god,
the Great God, stay with us,
but since it is already dark today,
we will have the Great God stay with us tonight, and tomorrow we will send the Great God off with just inau."
He repeated his bows many times while saying this.
The old woman laid a mat under the east window and placed me there.
Then, as soon as everyone went to sleep, they fell into a deep sleep, snoring loudly.
I sat between the ears of my body,
but soon, right around midnight,
I got up.
Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me,
golden drops fall, fall around me,"
I flew with a beautiful sound from the left side of this house to the right side.
When I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, god's treasures, fell and scattered around me with a beautiful sound.
In an instant, I filled this small house with magnificent treasures,
god's treasures.
Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me,
golden drops fall, fall around me,"
I transformed this small house into a house of gold, a large house, in an instant.
I created a storage place for magnificent treasures inside the house,
and I quickly made beautiful, magnificent clothes and decorated the house.
I decorated the inside of this large house more magnificently than a wealthy man's house.
When I finished that, I sat between the ears of my helmet as before.
I showed the people in the house a dream
to let them know that I saw the Ainu Nishpa who was unlucky and became poor
being ridiculed and bullied by those who were once poor but now rich,
and I felt sorry for him, so I, who am not just a humble god,
stayed at a human's house and gave them blessings.
After that was done, a little later, when it dawned,
the people in the house woke up together
and rubbed their eyes, looking inside the house, and they all
lost their strength and sat down on the floor. The old woman
cried out, and the old man
shed large tears,
but soon, the old man got up
and came to me, bowing twenty or thirty times,
and then said,
"I thought it was just a dream, just sleep,
but it really happened.
It is insignificant, insignificant, we are grateful just for you
coming to our humble home,
but the country's god, the Great God, has pitied our unfortunate
circumstances and given us
the greatest of blessings."
He said this while crying.
Then, the old man cut down an inau tree
and made a magnificent inau beautifully and decorated me.
The old woman dressed herself
and had the small child help her, gathering firewood
and drawing water, preparing to make sake, and in an instant
she lined up six sake barrels on the upper seat.
Then I talked with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and
various gods.
After two days, because it is the god's favorite,
the scent of sake
wafted through the house.
So, they deliberately dressed the small child in
old clothes and sent him out
to invite the people in the village
who were once poor but now rich.
As they watched him go, the child went to each house
and delivered the message,
and the people who were once poor but now rich
laughed loudly,
"This is strange, what kind of sake are the poor people making,
what kind of feast is there that they are inviting people for?
Let's go see what's going on and laugh at them."
Saying this, they came in a large group,
and from far away, just seeing the house,
they were surprised and embarrassed, and some went home as they were.
Some came to the front of the house and lost their strength and sat down.
Then, the lady of the house came outside
and took everyone's hand and led them into the house,
and everyone crawled in,
not even raising their faces.
Then, the master of the house got up
and spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird.
He told the story of what had happened,
"Like this, we were poor and could not
come and go freely with each other,
but the Great God has pitied us, and we have no bad thoughts,
so we have received these blessings.
From now on, everyone in the village, we are all family,
so we want everyone to be on good terms
and come and go with each other."
When he said this,
the people
repeatedly rubbed their hands together
and apologized to the master of the house for their sins, and from now on
they talked about being on good terms.
I was also worshiped by everyone.
When that was done, everyone's hearts softened
and they held a lively banquet.
I, while talking with the god of fire, the god of the house, and
the god of the gohei shelf,
watched the humans dance and leap
and was deeply amused. And
after two or three days, the banquet ended.
Seeing the humans being on good terms,
I was relieved
and said goodbye to the god of fire, the god of the house,
and the god of the gohei shelf.
When that was done, I returned to my own home.
Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful gohei
and fine sake.
So, I sent messengers to the near gods and the far gods
to invite them, and I held a lively banquet. At the banquet, to the gods
I told the story, the situation of the village when I visited the human village,
and when I told the details of the events,
the gods praised me greatly.
When the gods returned, I gave them two or three beautiful gohei.
Looking towards that Ainu village,
it is now peaceful, and the humans
are all on good terms, and that Nishpa
is the head of the village.
His child is now an adult,
has a wife and children,
and is filial to his father and mother.
Whenever they make sake,
at the beginning of the banquet, they send me gohei and sake.
I also sit behind the humans
and always
protect the human country."
So, the owl god told the story.

The Owl God's Own Sung Ballad
"Silver droplets fall, fall all around"

"Silver droplets fall, fall all around, golden droplets
fall, fall all around." As I sang this song,
I descended along the river, passing over human villages,
and gazing down, I saw
that the poor of old had become rich, and the rich of old
had become poor.
On the beach, human children were playing with toy bows
and toy arrows.
"Silver droplets fall, fall all around,
golden droplets fall, fall all around." As I sang this song,
I passed over the children,
and as they ran beneath me, they said:
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Come, shoot arrows at that bird.
The one who shoots down the god's bird, the first to take it,
is the true hero, the true strong one!"
As they said this, the children of those who were once poor but now rich,
strung golden bows with golden arrows
and shot at me, but I let the golden arrows
pass beneath me or above me.
Among these children,
there was one child who joined them with a plain (wooden) bow and plain arrows.
When I saw him, I thought he looked like a poor child,
which I could tell from his clothes.
But when I looked closely at his eyes,
they seemed like those of a great person's descendant, a solitary
figure joining their ranks. He too strung his plain bow
with plain arrows and aimed at me,
and the children who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly
saying:
"How ridiculous, child of the poor!
That bird, the god's bird, doesn't even heed our
golden arrows, so how could it ever
heed your rotten wooden arrows,
child of the poor?"
Saying this, they kicked and beat the poor child.
But the poor child
didn't mind at all and just kept aiming at me.
When I saw this, I felt very sorry for him.
"Silver droplets fall, fall all around,
golden droplets fall, fall all around." As I sang this song,
I slowly drew circles
in the great sky. The poor child,
standing with one foot far away and one foot close,
gritted his lower lip and aimed at me,
then shot his arrow with a whoosh. The small arrow flew beautifully
toward me, so I reached out
my hand and caught the small arrow.
Spinning around and around, I
cut through the wind and danced down.
Then, the children ran,
raising a sandstorm as they competed.
As I fell to the ground, the poor child
was the first to rush to my side and take me.
Then, the children of those who were once poor but now rich
ran up from behind
and hurled twenty or thirty insults,
pushing and beating the poor child,
"You hateful child, child of the poor!
You dared to get ahead of us!"
Saying this, the poor child
covered me and pressed me tightly against his stomach.
Struggling and struggling, he finally
jumped out of the crowd, and then, he ran as fast as he could.
The children who were once poor but now rich
threw stones and pieces of wood,
but the poor child didn't mind at all,
running and raising a sandstorm until he reached a small hut.
The child
put me in through the first window, and
added words, telling the story of what had happened.
From inside the house, an old couple
came out shielding their eyes with their hands,
and saw that, although they were very poor,
they possessed the grace of a gentleman and lady.
When they saw me, they bent deeply at the waist and were startled.
The old man straightened his belt,
and bowed to me,
"Owl God, Great God,
Thank you for coming to our poor and humble home.
In the past, we were wealthy enough to count ourselves among the rich,
but now we have become such
inconsequential poor people, and to have the country's god,
the Great God, stay with us is
awe-inspiring, but since it is already
dark today, please allow the Great God to
stay with us for the night, and tomorrow, we will send you off
with just a simple Inau."
Saying this, he bowed again and again.
The old woman spread a mat
beneath the eastern window and placed me there.
Then everyone went to sleep and immediately began to snore loudly.
I was sitting between the ears of my body,
and soon, right at midnight,
woke up.
"Silver droplets fall, fall all around,
golden droplets fall, fall all around."
While quietly singing this song,
I flew to the left seat and the right seat of this house,
making beautiful sounds.
When I flapped my wings, around me
beautiful treasures, divine treasures, fell and scattered,
making beautiful sounds.
In an instant, I filled this small house with splendid treasures,
divine treasures.
"Silver droplets fall, fall all around,
golden droplets fall, fall all around."
While singing this song, I transformed this small house
into a golden house, a large house, in an instant.
Inside the house, I created a storage place for splendid treasures,
quickly making splendid and beautiful clothes
to decorate the house.
I decorated this large house more splendidly than a rich man's house.
After I finished doing this,
I returned to my original form and sat between the ears
of my helmet.
I made the people of the house dream
and told them that an Ainu Nispa had become poor due to bad luck
and was being ridiculed and bullied by those who were once poor but now rich.
I felt sorry for him when I saw this,
so I, who am not a lowly god,
stayed in the human's house
and bestowed blessings upon them.
After doing this, a little while passed and it dawned,
and the people of the house woke up together.
Rubbing their eyes, they looked inside the house, and everyone
collapsed onto the floor in shock. The old woman
cried out loud, and the old man
shed large tears,
but soon, the old man stood up
came to me, bowed twenty or thirty times,
and then said:
"I thought it was just a dream, just sleep,
but it was real, and we received your blessings.
Our humble house is insignificant,
and we are grateful that you would even visit us,
but the country's god, the Great God, pitied our
unfortunate circumstances
and bestowed upon us the greatest of blessings."
Saying this, he spoke while crying.
Then, the old man cut Inau wood
and made splendid Inau beautifully to decorate me.
The old woman dressed up
and had the small child help her, gathering firewood
and drawing water, preparing to brew sake, and in an instant
she lined up six sake barrels in the upper seat.
Then I talked with the old woman of fire, the old goddess,
about various stories of the gods.
After about two days, because it was something the gods liked,
the scent of sake
filled the house.
So, they deliberately had that small child
wear old clothes and sent him to the village
to invite the people who were once poor but now rich.
Seeing him off, the child went from house to house
and delivered the invitation,
and the people who were once poor but now rich
laughed loudly,
"How strange, that the poor
would brew sake and have
delicacies, and that they would invite people for that reason.
Let's go see what's so funny."
Saying this, a large group of them came together,
and from far away, just seeing the house,
they were surprised and ashamed, and some went straight home.
Some came to the front of the house and collapsed on the ground.
Then, the lady of the house went outside
took everyone's hand and brought them into the house,
and everyone crawled in on their knees,
not daring to raise their heads.
Then, the master of the house stood up
and spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird.
He told the story of what had happened,
"Like this, because we were poor, we could not
interact with each other,
but the Great God pitied us, and we had no bad intentions,
so we received these blessings.
From now on, we are all one family
in this village,
so I hope that everyone can get along
and interact with each other."
Saying this,
the people rubbed their hands together again and again,
apologized to the master of the house, and discussed
getting along from now on.
I was also worshiped by everyone.
After that was finished, everyone's hearts softened,
and they held a grand banquet.
I talked with the fire god, the house god,
and the gods of the sacred space,
watching the humans dance and leap,
and was deeply delighted. And then,
after two or three days, the banquet ended.
Seeing the humans getting along,
I felt relieved
and said goodbye to the fire god, the house god,
and the gods of the sacred space.
After that was finished, I returned to my home.
Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful sacred treasures
and fine sake.
So I sent messengers
to invite the nearby and distant gods and held a grand banquet.
At the banquet, I told the gods
in detail about the situation in the human village
when I visited it, and the events that had occurred,
and the gods praised me greatly.
When the gods left, I gave them beautiful sacred treasures,
two or three each.
Looking towards that Ainu village,
it is now peaceful, and the humans
are all getting along, and that Nispa
is the head of the village.
His child is now an adult,
has a wife and children,
and is filial to his parents.
Whenever he brews sake,
he sends me sacred treasures and sake at the beginning of the banquet.
I also sit behind the humans
and always

So, the owl god told the story.
