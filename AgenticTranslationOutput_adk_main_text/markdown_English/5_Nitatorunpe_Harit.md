The bog demon himself sang the chant, "Harits Kunna"

Harits Kunna
One day, as the weather was fine,
I was looking out from my bog,
with only my eyes and mouth showing,
when I heard voices coming from the beach.
I saw two young men approaching together.
The first one seemed to be a hero,
possessing the qualities of a hero,
as beautiful as a god.
But when I looked at the one behind him,
he was an unpleasant man
with a bad complexion. They were talking as they came,
and as they passed by my bog,
just as they came in front of me, the man with the bad complexion
stopped, stopped and covered his nose.
"Oh, it stinks, this nasty bog! Passing by this foul bog,
what is this filthy, stinking thing?"
he said.
I only heard it, but I was so angry that
I didn't know whether I was there or not.
I jumped out of the mud. When I jumped up,
the ground cracked and broke. Gnashing my teeth,
I chased after them fiercely,
but the first one, seeing that,
turned back like a fish turning around,
went under the arm of the man with the bad complexion,
and ran away.
I chased the blue man for two or three intervals,
and quickly caught up with him and swallowed him whole.
Then I chased after the other man with all my speed,
and arrived behind a human village, a large village.
I saw coming from the other side
a fire old woman, a divine old woman, in a red garment,
six layers of clothing,
with a sash tied, wearing six layers of clothing,
leaning on a red staff, flying towards me.
"Well, well, what are you doing coming to this Ainu village?
Now go home, now go home!"
As she said this, she raised her red staff, her metal staff,
and struck me, and flames
rained down on me from the staff.
But I didn't care at all,
and gnashing my teeth,
I chased after the man, and the man ran around the village
like a well-worn ring. As I flew after him,
the earth cracked and the earth broke. The village was in an uproar,
some pulling their wives' hands, some pulling their children's hands, crying and screaming,
fleeing, a boiling scene, but
I didn't care at all, raising dust storms.
The fire old goddess ran beside me,
and tremendous flames flew over me.
In the midst of that, the man jumped into a house
and immediately jumped out again.
I saw him nocking a small arrow of artemisia to a small bow of artemisia
and aiming at me from the other side with a smile.
Seeing that, I thought it was funny.
"How can anyone suffer from such a small arrow of artemisia?"
I thought, and gnashing my teeth,
I tried to swallow him whole,
but at that moment the man
shot my head severely. After that, I didn't know what happened.
When I came to my senses,
I was between the ears of a large dragon.
The villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased
gave loud instructions, and everyone finely chopped up my corpse,
carried it to one place, burned it, and threw the ashes
behind the rocks of the mountain.
Now that I see it, it was not just a human,
not just a young man, but
Okikirmui, a divine hero.
A terrible evil god, a demon god, that's what I was,
and because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui, thinking of the village, angered me,
made me chase him, and killed me with an arrow of artemisia.
And the blue man I swallowed earlier,
I thought he was a human,
but it was Okikirmui who made his excrement into a person,
and brought him along.
Because I was a demon god, I have now been
sent to the terrible, evil land of hell,
so from now on, there will be no danger
or nuisance in the human land.
I was a terrible demon god,
but I was defeated by the strategy of a single human
and now I am dying a meaningless death, a bad death.
So the bog demon told the story.

The song "Haritsu Kunna" sung by the swamp demon himself.

Haritsu Kunna
One day, because the weather was fine,
I was looking out from my swamp with only my eyes and mouth
Exposed, when I heard people talking from the beach.
I saw two young men coming together.
The first one seemed like a hero, possessing the qualities of a hero,
As beautiful as a god,
But when I looked at the one who came later, he looked bad,
With a pale face. They were talking about something
As they came, and as they passed by my swamp
Just as they came in front of me, the pale-faced man who came from behind
Stopped, stopped, and covered his nose.
"Oh, it stinks, this nasty swamp. Passing in front of this awful swamp
Is so dirty. What is this? It stinks so much."
He said.
I just listened, but I became so angry that I didn't even know if I existed.
I jumped out of the mud. When I jumped up,
The ground cracked and broke. While
Grinding my teeth, I chased after them fiercely,
But the first one, seeing that something was wrong,
Turned around like a fish turning back, and went under the armpit of the pale-faced man
And ran away.
I chased after the pale-faced man for two or three intervals,
Quickly caught up with him and swallowed him whole from the head.
So this time, I chased after him with all my might
And arrived at the back of a human village, a large village.
I saw from over there
The old woman of fire, the old woman of the gods, wearing red clothes, six layers of clothes,
With a belt tied, wearing six layers of clothes,
Holding a red staff, flying towards me.
"Well, well, what are you doing coming to this Ainu village?
Go home, go home."
While saying that, she raised the red staff, the golden staff, and
When she struck me, flames from the staff
Fell on me like rain.
But I didn't care at all,
While grinding my teeth, I chased after the man,
And the man ran around the village
Like a well-worn ring. Flying after him,
The ground cracked and broke. The village was in an uproar,
People pulling their wives' hands, people pulling their children's hands, crying and
Running away, a boiling scene, but
I didn't care at all, raising a dust storm,
The old goddess of fire ran to my side
Huge flames flew over my head.
In the midst of that, the man jumped into a house
And immediately jumped out again.
I saw him nocking a small arrow of mugwort to a small bow of mugwort
And from over there, smiling, aiming at me.
Seeing that, I thought it was funny.
"How can such a small mugwort arrow hurt anyone?"
While thinking that, I ground my teeth
And tried to swallow him from the head,
When the man shot my neck hard.
After that, I don't know what happened.
Suddenly I realized, and when I looked,
I was between the ears of a huge dragon.
The villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased
Was giving instructions in a loud voice, and everyone finely chopped up my corpse
And carried it to one place and burned it, and threw the ashes
Behind the rocks of the mountain.
Now I see for the first time that what I thought was just a human,
Just a young man,
Was Okikirmui, the hero of the gods.
A terrible bad god, a demon god, that's what I was,
And because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui, thinking of the village, angered me
Made me chase him, and killed me with a mugwort arrow.
And also, the pale-faced man I swallowed earlier,
I thought was a human,
But that was Okikirmui making his own feces into a human,
And bringing it with him.
Because I was a demon god, now I have already
Been sent to the terrible bad land of hell,
From now on, there will be no danger
Or obstacles in the human land.
I was a terrible demon god,
But I was defeated by the scheme of one human
And now I am going to die a boring death, a bad death.
So the swamp demon told the story.
