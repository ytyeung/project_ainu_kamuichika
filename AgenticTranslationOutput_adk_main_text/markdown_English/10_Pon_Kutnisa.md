Little Okikirmui himself sang the song:
"Kutunisa Kutonkuton"

Kutunisa Kutonkuton
One day, I went to play near the source of the river.
At the source, I saw a little man
Bending over to hammer stakes for a walnut weir.
When he saw me, he said,
"Who are you? My nephew, please help me."
I looked and saw it was a walnut weir,
So walnut water, muddy water,
Flowed, and when the salmon
came up, they hated the walnut water
And went back crying. I was angry,
So I snatched the mallet the little man was using to drive the stakes
And struck the small of his back,
And the sound rang out, "Pon!" I broke the little man's
back, killed him,
And kicked him down to hell. I shook
his walnut stake
And it seemed to reach beyond six hells.
Then, I put all the strength in my back, all the strength in my body,
And broke that stake from its base,
And kicked it down to hell.
Clear wind, clear water,
Flowed from the source, and the salmon that had gone back crying
Recovered their spirits in the clear wind, clear water,
And came up splashing and playing,
Making a great commotion and laughing.
Seeing that, I was relieved
And returned along the stream. So
little Okikirmui told the story.
```
#### Comments
Pros: Clear and understandable language. Accurately conveys the story's events.
Cons: The poetic flow is somewhat lacking; some phrases are a bit literal. The phrase 'small of his back' is a bit awkward.

A ballad sung by Little Okikirmui himself
"Kutsunisa Kutonkuton"

Kutsunisa Kutonkuton
One day, I went to play near the source of the water,
And I found a dwarf at the water source,
Bending over, hammering stakes to set up a walnut fish weir.
He saw me and said:
"Who are you? My nephew, please help me."
I saw that it was a walnut fish weir,
So walnut water, muddy water
Flowed, and the salmon
Wanted to go upstream, but because they hated the walnut water,
They left crying. I was very angry,
I snatched the mallet from the dwarf's hand,
And struck the center of the dwarf's waist
With a thud. I broke the dwarf's
Waist in the center, killed him,
And kicked him into hell. I tried shaking his walnut stake,
It seemed to extend to the other side of
Six levels of hell.
After that, I used all the strength in my waist, all the strength in my body,
And broke that stake from the root,
And kicked it into hell.
A refreshing wind and clear water flowed from
The water source, and the salmon who had left crying,
Were refreshed by the refreshing wind and clear water,
They made a lot of noise, laughed loudly, and played,
Splashing and
Going upstream. I saw this and felt relieved,
And returned along the river. So
Little Okikirmui told the story.
```
#### Comments
Pros: Good poetic flow and storytelling tone. Uses vivid language, such as 'refreshing wind and clear water'.
Cons: The phrase 'center of the dwarf's waist' is a bit awkward. The use of 'dwarf' might not be the best choice, depending on the context.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is slightly better due to its improved poetic flow and vivid language, which better captures the essence of the original Ainu chant. While both translations are accurate and easy to understand, Translation 2 has a more engaging and rhythmic quality.
