A song sung by Little Okikirmui himself:
"This sand is red, so red."

[This sand is red, so red]
One day, I went out to play, going up the stream,
and I met the child of a demon.
The demon's child is always beautiful in appearance,
beautiful in face, wearing black clothes,
holding a small walnut bow and walnut arrows.
When he saw me, he smiled and said,
"Little Okikirmui, let's play.
Now, I'll show you how to cut off the roots of the fish."
Saying this, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
and shot it towards the source of the water.
From the source, walnut water, muddy water,
flowed out, and when the salmon tried to come upstream,
they hated the walnut water and, crying,
returned and flowed away. The demon's child
was smiling at that.
I was angry when I saw that,
so I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow,
and shot it towards the source of the water.
From the source, silver water, clear water,
flowed out, and the salmon, who had been crying,
regained their energy in the clear water,
laughed loudly, played, and frolicked,
splashing up the river. Then, the demon's child,
showing his inherent tantrum on his face,
said, "If you really do such a thing, I'll show you
how to cut off the roots of the deer."
Saying this, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
and shot it into the sky. From the mountains and fields,
a walnut wind, a whirlwind, blew,
and from the mountains and fields, the herd of stags separately,
the herd of does separately, were blown up by the wind,
going up neatly lined up into the sky.
The demon's child was smiling.
When I saw that, I was furious,
so I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow,
and shot the arrow after the herd of deer.
From the sky, a silver wind, a clear wind,
blew down, and the herd of stags
separately, the herd of does separately,
were blown down onto the mountains and fields.
Then, the demon's child,
showing his inherent tantrum on his face,
said, "You impudent thing, if you really
do such a thing, let's have a trial of strength."
Saying this, he took off his jacket.
I also became one thin cloth, and we grappled.
He also grappled with me. Since then,
we wrestled, sometimes him on top, sometimes me on top,
but I was surprised at how strong the demon's child was.
However, finally, at one moment,
I put all the strength of my waist, the strength of my body,
and lifted the demon's child
up to my shoulders,
and the sound of me slamming him onto the mountain rock
resounded with a clang. After killing him and
kicking him down to hell, it became silent.
After that was over, I came back along the stream,
and in the river, the voices of the salmon laughing
and playing came up noisily,
splashing, I could hear. In the mountains and fields,
the voices of the stags and does laughing
and playing were everywhere,
eating things here and there. I saw that
and felt relieved, and to my home
I returned.
So, little Okikirmui told the story.

A Song Sung by Little Okikirmui Himself
"This sand is red, red"

[This sand is red, red]
One day, I went upstream to play,
And encountered the child of a demon.
Always, the child of a demon is beautiful in appearance,
Beautiful in face. Wearing black clothes,
Holding a small walnut bow and walnut arrows,
He saw me and said with a smile:
"Little Okikirmui, let's play.
Now, watch me cut off the fish's roots."
Saying this, he nocked a walnut arrow on his walnut bow,
And shot the arrow towards the water source,
From the water source flowed walnut water, turbid water,
When the salmon came upstream,
Hating the walnut water, they cried
And turned back, flowing downstream. The child of a demon
Just smiled at this.
I was angered by what I saw,
So I took my silver bow and silver arrows,
Nocked them, and shot the arrow towards the water source,
From the water source flowed silver water, clear water,
The salmon that had been flowing away crying
Regained their energy in the clear water,
Laughing loudly, playing and frolicking,
Splashing and going upstream.
Then, the child of a demon, his inherent impatience
Showing on his face,
"If you really do that, I'll cut off the deer's roots," he said,
Nocking a walnut arrow on his walnut bow,
Shooting into the sky, from the mountain trees
A walnut wind, a whirlwind, blew,
From the mountain trees, the stags separately,
The does also separately, were blown up by the wind,
Rising neatly into the sky in a long line.
The child of a demon smiled.
Seeing this, I was enraged,
So I nocked a silver arrow on my silver bow,
And shot the arrow after the departing deer,
From the sky, a silver wind, a clear wind,
Blew down, the stags
Separately, the does also separately,
Were blown down onto the mountain trees.
Then, the child of a demon
Showed his inherent impatience on his face,
"Insolent one,
If you really do that, let's have a trial of strength."
Saying this, he took off his jacket.
I was left in only a thin garment,
And grappled with him. He also grappled with me. From then on,
We pushed each other down and up, wrestling,
But I was surprised at how strong the child of a demon was.
However, finally, at one moment,
I used the strength of my waist, the strength of my body,
Giving all of my strength, the child of a demon
I hoisted him up to my shoulders,
The sound of me slamming him onto the mountain rocks
Echoed loudly. After killing him and kicking him into hell,
All around was silent.
When that was over, I returned along the river,
In the river, the sound of the salmon laughing,
The sound of them playing, rose noisily,
I could hear the splashing. In the mountain trees,
The stags, the does, the sound of them laughing,
The sound of them playing, filled the area,
Eating things here and there.
Seeing this, I felt relieved,
And returned to my home.
So, little Okikirmui told the story.
