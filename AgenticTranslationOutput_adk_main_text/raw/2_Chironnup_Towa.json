When I looked, it was my wife,\nWith a surprised look on her face, panting,\n\"What's wrong, dear?\"\nShe said, and when I looked,\nWhat looked like a fire,\nMy house was standing there as it was.\nNo fire, no smoke.\nIt was when my wife was milling,\nAt that time, the wind was blowing strongly, and the winnowed millet\nBran was being blown away,\nAnd I saw it as smoke.\nI went out to look for food, but I couldn't find any, and on top of that,\nI shouted loudly again, and my wife\nWas so surprised by my shout that she threw the millet she was winnowing\nAway with the winnowing basket,\nSo we won't be able to eat anything tonight.\nI was so angry that I threw myself under the bed\nAnd fell asleep.\n\"You dull-eyed, useless fellow,\nYou dull-eyed, bad fellow,\nYou smelly thing under the tail,\nYou rotten thing under the tail,\nYou thing with resin coming out of your butt,\nYou thing with dirty water coming out of your butt,\nWhat kind of way of looking at things is that!\"\nSo\nThe fox chief told the story.","title":"The fox himself sang the song \"Towatwato\"","comment":"Translated from Japanese to English.

Banzai!\"\nChara-chara through the stones,\nChara-chara through the wood chips,\nI went closer and closer, but when I arrived,\nContrary to all expectations,\nWhat I thought was a whale washed ashore\nWas just a dog's toilet on the beach,\nA large mountain of dung.\nThat is what I had mistaken for a whale.\nWhat I thought were humans rejoicing in the sea's bounty, dancing in the sea's bounty,\nCutting and carrying the meat,\nWere just crows\nPecking at the dung, scattering the dung,\nFlying this way and that.\nI was furious.\n\"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,\nYou dim-eyed, wicked wretch,\nYou stinky thing beneath the tail,\nYou rotten thing beneath the tail,\nYou whose rear oozes resin,\nYou whose rear drips filthy water,\nWhat a way to see things!\"\nThen again,\nChara-chara through the stones,\nChara-chara through the wood chips,\nRunning from the seaside,\nI looked ahead and saw\nA boat, and in that boat\nTwo humans were exchanging condolences.\n\"Oh, what sudden event\nHas caused them to do such a thing? Perhaps\nSomeone has capsized with the boat,\nAh, I must hurry closer\nAnd hear what they are saying.\"\nThinking this, I shouted loudly, \"Hohohoi!\"\nChara-chara through the stones,\nChara-chara through the wood chips,\nI flew as if on wings and went to see,\nBut what I thought was a boat was just\nA rock on the beach, and what I thought were people\nWere just two large cormorants.\nI saw the two large cormorants stretching and shrinking their long necks\nAs if they were exchanging condolences.\n\"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,\nYou dim-eyed, wicked wretch,\nYou stinky thing beneath the tail,\nYou rotten thing beneath the tail,\nYou whose rear oozes resin,\nYou whose rear drips filthy water,\nWhat a way to see things!\"\nThen again,\nChara-chara through the stones,\nChara-chara through the wood chips,\nI flew as if on wings and went up the river,\nAnd far upstream\nTwo women were standing in the shallows, weeping together.\nSeeing this, I was startled.\n\"Oh, what bad thing has happened,\nWhat ill omen has come that they are weeping so?\nAh, I must hurry and arrive\nAnd hear what they are saying.\"\nThinking this,\nChara-chara through the stones,\nChara-chara through the wood chips,\nI flew as if on wings and went to see,\nBut in the middle of the river were two fish weirs,\nAnd the stakes of the two weirs were being hit by the current and shaking,\nAnd I thought the two women were looking up and down at them and\nWeeping together.\n\"You dim-eyed, worthless fool,\nYou dim-eyed, wicked wretch,\nYou stinky thing beneath the tail,\nYou rotten thing beneath the tail,\nYou whose rear oozes resin,\nYou whose rear drips filthy water,\nWhat a way to see things!\"\nThen again, going up the river,\nChara-chara through the stones,\nChara-chara through the wood chips,\nI flew as if on wings and came back.\nI looked ahead and saw\nThat for some reason\nMy house was ablaze,\nThe smoke rising into the sky\nLike gathering clouds.
