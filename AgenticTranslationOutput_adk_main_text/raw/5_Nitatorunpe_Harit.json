The village was in an uproar,\nsome pulling their wives' hands, some pulling their children's hands, crying and screaming,\nfleeing, a boiling scene, but\nI didn't care at all, raising dust storms.\nThe fire old goddess ran beside me,\nand tremendous flames flew over me.\nIn the midst of that, the man jumped into a house\nand immediately jumped out again.\nI saw him nocking a small arrow of artemisia to a small bow of artemisia\nand aiming at me from the other side with a smile.\nSeeing that, I thought it was funny.\n\"How can anyone suffer from such a small arrow of artemisia?\"\nI thought, and gnashing my teeth,\nI tried to swallow him whole,\nbut at that moment the man\nshot my head severely. After that, I didn't know what happened.\nWhen I came to my senses,\nI was between the ears of a large dragon.\nThe villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased\ngave loud instructions, and everyone finely chopped up my corpse,\ncarried it to one place, burned it, and threw the ashes\nbehind the rocks of the mountain.\nNow that I see it, it was not just a human,\nnot just a young man, but\nOkikirmui, a divine hero.\nA terrible evil god, a demon god, that's what I was,\nand because I was near the human village,\nOkikirmui, thinking of the village, angered me,\nmade me chase him, and killed me with an arrow of artemisia.\nAnd the blue man I swallowed earlier,\nI thought he was a human,\nbut it was Okikirmui who made his excrement into a person,\nand brought him along.\nBecause I was a demon god, I have now been\nsent to the terrible, evil land of hell,\nso from now on, there will be no danger\nor nuisance in the human land.\nI was a terrible demon god,\nbut I was defeated by the strategy of a single human\nand now I am dying a meaningless death, a bad death.\nSo the bog demon told the story.","score_accuracy":4,"score_easy_understanding":4,"score_poetic_flow":3,"weighted_score":3.9,"comment":"The translation preserves most of the original meaning and is understandable.
