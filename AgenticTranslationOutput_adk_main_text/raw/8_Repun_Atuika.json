Even if you give them so much sea bounty,\nThe lowly humans, the wicked humans, do not feel grateful and do such things.\"\nHearing this, I laughed and said:\n\"Since I have given it to the humans,\nIt is now their property, so whether the humans\nPoke at their possessions with sickles or\nScrape them with axes,\nThey are free to eat them as they please,\nSo what?\"\nThe sea spirit was somewhat disconcerted,\nBut I didn't care at all, and on the sea\nI swam leisurely,\nAnd as the sun was about to set, I arrived at my sea.\nI saw that\nTwelve brothers, twelve\nsisters, could not carry that half whale,\nAnd everyone was shouting loudly,\nMoving slowly to the east of the sea.\nI was truly amazed.\nI ignored them and went home,\nAnd sat on the high platform.\nThen, looking back at the human world,\nI saw that around the one and a\nhalf whales that I had pushed up, splendid men and\nsplendid women were gathered in full dress,\nJoyfully dancing and rejoicing at the sea bounty, and on the dunes behind,\nSplendid mats were spread,\nAnd on them, the village chief of Otashutsu Village\nWas wearing six kimonos, with a belt tied, wearing six kimonos\nOver his shoulders, with a splendid god's crown, an ancestral crown,\nOn his head, and a divinely granted sword at his waist,\nLooking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high\nAnd worshiping. The humans were crying\nAnd rejoicing at the sea bounty.\nThe sea spirit said that the humans\nWere poking at the whale I had pushed up with axes and sickles,\nBut the villagers,\nStarting with the village chief,\nTook out the divine sword, which they had always considered their most precious treasure,\nAnd were cutting the meat with it and carrying it away.\nAnd also, my brothers and sisters showed no signs of returning.\nTwo or three days passed, and then, towards the window,\nSomething seemed to be there, so\nI turned around and saw that on the window\nA golden cup was overflowing\nWith sake, and on top of it\nWere sake chopsticks with gohei attached,\nMoving back and forth, stating their message as envoys:\n\"I am from Otashutsu Village,\nAnd though it is a great honor, I offer this sake.\"\nThe village chief of Otashutsu Village, representing\nAll the villagers, explained in detail the circumstances of expressing their gratitude to me,\n\"Tomin karikuru kamui karikuru isoyankekuru\nIf not for the great god, the brave god,\nWho would have pity on our village, which is suffering from famine\nAnd is in such a desperate situation\nThat we are extremely short of food?\nYou have given life to our village,\nWe are truly grateful, we rejoice in the sea bounty,\nWe have made a little sake,\nAnd we offer a small gohei as a token of our gratitude\nto the great god.\"\nThe sake chopsticks with gohei attached moved back and forth, stating their message.\nSo I got up, took the golden cup,\nHeld it high above my head,\nOpened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,\nPoured in a little fine sake,\nAnd placed the golden cup on the window.\nWhen that was done, I sat down on the high platform\nAnd saw that the cup had disappeared along with the chopsticks. Then, carving scabbards,\nCarving scabbards, and then\nSuddenly looking up,\nThe house was full of beautiful gohei,\nAnd the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning\nWas flashing. I thought, ah, how beautiful.\nThen again, two or three days passed,\nAnd then finally, outside the house, the brothers and\nsisters were shouting loudly,\nAnd I began to hear them pulling the whale. I was amazed.\nLooking at them entering the house,\nThe brothers and sisters\nWere very tired, and their faces were pale.\nWhen everyone had come in, they saw so many gohei,\nAnd were surprised and bowed many times.\nBefore long, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat\nWere overflowing, and the scent of sake,\nbeloved by the gods, filled the house.\nThen I decorated the house with beautiful gohei,\nInvited the gods of distant places and the gods of nearby places\nAnd held a grand banquet. The sisters\nBoiled whale meat and offered it to the gods,\nAnd the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.\nWhen the banquet was at its height, I stood up\nAnd explained in detail how there was a famine in the human world,\nAnd how I felt pity and pushed up the sea bounty,\nAnd how when I treated the humans well, the evil gods\nWere jealous of it, and the sea spirit slandered me,\nAnd how the village chief of Otashutsu Village\nSpoke those words and expressed his gratitude to me,\nAnd how the sake chopsticks with gohei attached came as envoys, etc.\nThe gods\nAll nodded in unison,\nPraising me.\nThen again, a grand banquet was held,\nAnd the sounds of the gods\nDancing and leaping there and here\nMade beautiful sounds, and the sisters\nSometimes went around the seats with a sake pourer,\nAnd sometimes sang with the goddesses\nIn beautiful voices.\nTwo or three days passed, and the banquet ended.\nI gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,\nAnd the gods bent their waists\nAnd bowed many times,\nAnd everyone returned to their own homes.\nAfter that, always together with the eldest brother, six brothers,\nThe eldest sister, six sisters, the younger sister, six sisters,\nThe younger brother, six brothers,\nWhenever the humans made sake,\nThey would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.\nNow, the humans no longer lack food,\nNor do they have any difficulties, and they live\nPeacefully, so I am at peace.","title":"The Sea God's Tale","comment":"This is a translation of Ainu chant, sung by Ainu gods telling their stories.

カムイカリクル

イソヤンケクル\n勇敢的神明，大神明，\n您是為了什麼，將這麼大的海幸賜給卑賤的人類，邪惡的人類呢？\n卑賤的人類，邪惡的人類，用斧頭\n用鐮刀將巨大的海幸切碎、戳刺、\n削割著，勇敢的神明，\n大神明，快點將大海幸\n收回去吧。就算您賜予他們這麼多的海幸，\n卑賤的人類，邪惡的人類也不覺得感激，反而做出這種事。」\n聽了牠的話，我笑著說道：\n「我既然已經給了人類，\n現在就是他們的東西了，人類\n要用鐮刀戳刺自己的財產，還是用斧頭\n削割自己的東西，隨他們\n自由地吃掉不就好了嗎？\n那又有什麼不對嗎？」\n海のごめ雖然有些不知所措，\n我卻一點也不在意，在海上\n悠閒地游著，\n快要日落的時候，抵達了我的海域。\n一看，\n十二位兄長，十二位\n姊姊，搬不動那半條鯨魚，\n大家一起高聲呼喊著，\n在海的東邊，慢吞吞地搬運著。\n我實在是太吃驚了。\n我沒有理會他們，回到\n家裡，坐在高床上。\n於是在後面回頭看著人類的世界，\n只見我推上去的那一條\n半鯨魚的周圍，聚集著盛裝打扮的體面的男人們和\n體面的女人們，\n歡喜地跳舞，歡欣鼓舞，後面的沙丘\n上鋪著華麗的墊子，\nオタシュツ村的村長\n身穿六件長袍，束著腰帶，\n披著六件長袍，頭戴\n華麗的神之冠，祖先的冠冕，\n腰佩神授之劍，\n如神一般美麗，高舉雙手\n禮拜著。人類們哭泣著\n喜悅著海幸。\n海のごめ說人類\n用斧頭和鐮刀戳刺我推上去的鯨魚，\n但村長為首的\n村民們，從以前開始\n就取出視為最珍貴寶物的神劍，\n用它來切割肉並搬運著。\n而且，我的兄長們和姊姊們也沒有回來的\n跡象。\n過了兩三天，窗戶的方向\n好像有什麼東西，於是\n回頭一看，只見窗戶上\n放著一個裝滿酒的金杯，上面\n放著裝飾著御幣的酒筷，\n來回移動著，作為使者陳述道：\n「我是オタシュツ村的人，\n雖然非常惶恐，還是要獻上酒。」\nオタシュツ村的村長代表\n全體村民向我表達謝意，\n詳細地講述了事情的經過，\n「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル\n如果不是大神明，勇敢的神明，\n誰會憐憫我們村子遭受饑荒，\n已經到了走投無路的地步，\n食物極度匱乏的時候呢？\n您賜予我們村子生命，\n實在非常感謝，我們歡喜海幸，\n製作了少許的酒，\n附上小小的幣束，向大神明\n表達謝意。」\n裝飾著幣束的酒筷來回移動著陳述著。\n於是我起身，拿起金杯，\n舉過頭頂，\n打開上方座位的六個酒桶的蓋子，\n倒入少許美酒，\n將金杯放在窗戶上。\n做完這些後，我坐在高床上，\n只見那個杯子連同筷子一起\n消失了。之後，我雕刻刀鞘，\n雕鏤刀鞘，不久\n抬頭一看，\n屋子裡擺滿了美麗的幣束，\n屋子裡白雲繚繞，白色的閃電\n閃閃發光。我覺得啊，真美啊。\n之後又過了兩三天，\n這時終於，在家外面，兄長們和\n姊姊們高聲呼喊著，\n開始拉著那條鯨魚回來了。我驚呆了。\n看著他們進入屋子的樣子，\n兄長們和姊姊們\n非常疲憊，臉色也憔悴了。\n大家都進來後，看到這麼多的幣束，\n驚訝地拜了又拜。\n不久，東邊座位的六個酒桶\n都滿溢出來，神明喜愛的\n酒香在屋子裡飄蕩。\n之後，我用美麗的幣束裝飾屋子，\n邀請遠方的神明，附近的\n神明，舉辦盛大的酒宴。姊姊們\n煮了鯨魚肉，獻給神明們，\n神明們咂著嘴，非常高興。\n宴會正酣時，我起身，\n詳細地講述了人間世界遭受饑荒，\n我憐憫他們，將海幸推上去的經過，\n以及我善待人類，卻遭到邪惡的神明\n嫉妒，海のごめ中傷我的事情，\nオタシュツ村的\n村長說了那些話，向我表達謝意，\n裝飾著幣束的酒筷作為使者前來的事情等等，\n神明們\n一起點頭，\n稱讚我。\n之後又舉辦了盛大的宴會，\n神明們的，在那裡\n這裡跳舞的聲音，躍動的聲音\n發出美妙的聲響，姊姊們\n有的拿著提子在席間斟酒，\n有的和女神們\n一起用美妙的聲音歌唱。\n過了兩三天，宴會結束了。\n我給神明們兩三個美麗的幣束，\n神明們彎著腰\n不停地鞠躬，\n大家都回到自己的家裡。\n在那之後，無論何時都和長兄，六位兄長，\n長姊，六位姊姊，短姊，六位姊姊，\n短兄，六位兄長在一起，\n人類們每次釀酒，\n都會給我送酒，給我送來幣束。\n現在，人類們既不缺食物，\n也沒有什麼困難，平穩地\n生活著，所以我很安心。","title":"海神自述","comment":"這是一首由阿伊努神祇講述他們故事的阿伊努語聖歌翻譯。

The humans were crying\nAnd rejoicing over the sea bounty.\nWhat the grebe had said about the humans\nPoking at the whale I had beached with\nAxes and sickles was not true;\nthe village chief and\nThe villagers were taking out\nThe divine sword, which they had long considered\nThe most precious of treasures,\nAnd using it to cut the meat and carry it away.\nThen, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.\nTwo or three days passed, and something\nSeemed to appear in the window, so\nI turned and looked, and on the window\nWas a golden cup, filled to overflowing\nWith sake, and on it\nWere sacred chopsticks with gohei attached,\nGoing back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,\n\"I am a person from Otasutsu Village,\nAnd with great reverence, I offer you sake.\"\nThe village chief of Otasutsu Village,\nRepresenting all the villagers,\nspoke in detail of the circumstances in which he offered his thanks to me,\n\"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur\nGreat God, if not for you, Brave God,\nWho would have pitied our village, where there was a famine\nAnd we were so desperately\nLacking in food?\nThank you truly for giving life to our village.\nRejoicing over the sea bounty,\nWe have made a little sake,\nAdded a small nusa,\nAnd offer our thanks to the Great God.\"\nThis was what\nThe gohei-adorned chopsticks declared, going back and forth.\nSo I rose, took\nThe golden cup, and raised it to my forehead,\nOpened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,\nPoured a little fine sake into each,\nAnd placed the golden cup on the window.\nWhen that was done, I sat down on the raised platform\nAnd saw that the cup had disappeared, along with the chopsticks.\nThen, carving sheaths\nAnd engraving sheaths, presently\nI raised my face and saw\nThat the house was full of beautiful gohei,\nAnd the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning\nWas flashing brightly.

My sisters\nBoiled the whale and offered it to the gods,\nAnd the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.\nWhen the banquet was at its height, I rose\nAnd told in detail how there had been a famine in the human world\nAnd, feeling pity, I had beached the sea bounty,\nAnd how, when I had done good to the humans, the evil gods\nWere jealous of it, and the sea grebe had slandered me,\nAnd how the village chief of Otasutsu Village\nHad taken those words and offered his thanks to me,\nAnd how the gohei-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy,\nAnd the gods\nAll nodded in unison,\nPraising me.\nThen again, we held a grand banquet,\nAnd the sounds of the gods\nDancing and leaping here and there\nMade a beautiful sound, and my sisters\nCarried the choshi and went around pouring sake between the seats,\nAnd sang in beautiful voices with the goddesses.\nTwo or three days passed, and the banquet closed.\nI gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,\nAnd the gods bent low at the waist\nAnd bowed many times over,\nAnd all returned to their own homes.\nAfter that, as always, my eldest brother, six brothers,\nMy eldest sister, six sisters, my younger sister, six sisters,\nMy younger brother, six brothers, were with me,\nAnd whenever the humans made sake,\nThey would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.\nNow the humans have no lack of food\nAnd live in peace, without any troubles,\nSo I am at ease.","title":"The Song of the Sea God","comment":"Translated the Ainu chant from Japanese to English, keeping a story-telling and poetic tone.
