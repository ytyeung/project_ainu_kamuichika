Koshitemutori\n在國家的海岬，神靈的海岬之上，\n我靜靜地坐著。\n某一天，我走到外面張望，\n海面平靜而遼闊，在海上，\n奧基基里姆伊、舒蓬拉姆卡和薩馬雲庫爾\n三人乘船出海狩獵。看到此景，\n我內心的邪惡開始蠢動。\n這海岬，國家的海岬，神靈的海岬，\n之上，一上一下，\n我輕盈地邁著步伐，柔軟地扭動腰肢，四處奔走。\n用沉重的語氣，彷彿折斷木片般，我喊著：「Pau, pau！」\n怒視著這條河的源頭，召喚著暴風雨的魔鬼。\n於是，作為回應，從這條河的源頭，\n一股猛烈的風，一陣旋風，\n爆發而出，衝入大海，隨即\n這片海，上面的海變成了下面的海，\n下面的海變成了上面的海。奧基基里姆伊他們的\n漁船，在近海之人和陸地之人的海\n交匯之處（海中央），遭遇了突如其來的變化，在波浪中\n旋轉起來。巨大的海浪如山一般，\n朝著船隻傾覆而來。然後，\n奧基基里姆伊、薩馬雲庫爾、舒蓬拉姆卡\n發出吶喊，奮力划船。\n這艘小船像飛舞的落葉般被吹走，\n眼看就要傾覆，\n但令人欽佩的是，人類是如此強大，\n這艘小船在風中，\n在波浪上滑行。\n看到這一幕，我內心的邪惡再次蠢動。\n我輕盈地邁著步伐，柔軟地扭動腰肢，四處奔走，\n用沉重的語氣，彷彿折斷木片般，喊著：「Pau, pau！」\n全心全意地為暴風雨的魔鬼助威。\n就這樣，終於，薩馬雲庫爾的\n雙手，從上到下，都流出了鮮血，\n精疲力竭地倒下了。\n看到他那副模樣，我暗自竊笑。\n然後，再次竭盡全力，\n輕盈地邁著步伐，柔軟地扭動腰肢，四處奔走，\n用沉重的語氣，彷彿折斷木片般，喊叫著，\n為暴風雨的魔鬼助威。\n奧基基里姆伊和舒蓬拉姆卡兩人，\n互相鼓勵，勇敢地划著船，\n但是，突然，在某一刻，舒蓬拉姆卡的\n雙手，從上到下，都流出了鮮血，\n精疲力竭地倒下了。看到這一幕，\n我暗自笑了。\n然後，我又輕盈地邁著步伐，柔軟地扭動腰肢，\n跳躍著，用沉重的語氣，彷彿折斷堅硬的木片\n般，喊叫著，竭盡全力。\n但是，奧基基里姆伊卻沒有絲毫疲憊的樣子。\n他用一塊薄布裹住身體，\n划著船，直到\n他手中握著的槳折斷了。\n於是，他跳到疲憊不堪、奄奄一息的薩馬雲庫爾身上，\n奪過他手中的槳，獨自划著船。\n我看到這一幕，我那與生俱來的邪惡之心又開始蠢動。\n用沉重的語氣，彷彿折斷堅硬的木片般，我喊叫著，\n輕盈地邁著步伐，柔軟地扭動腰肢，四處奔走，\n竭盡全力地為暴風雨的魔鬼助威。\n就這樣，薩馬雲庫爾的舵也\n折斷了。奧基基里姆伊跳到舒蓬拉姆卡身上，\n奪過他的槳，\n勇敢地划著船。\n但是，他的槳也被海浪折斷了。\n於是，奧基基里姆伊\n靜靜地站在船中，在猛烈的風中，\n從未想過身為人類的他會找到我，\n他凝視著我的眼睛中央，\n在國家的海岬，神靈的海岬之上。\n他那原本溫和的臉龐，露出了憤怒的神色，\n他擺弄著他的袋子，\n從中取出了一把小小的艾草弓\n和一支小小的艾草箭。\n看到這一幕，我暗自笑了。\n「人類能做什麼？有什麼可怕的？\n他能用這艾草箭做什麼呢？」\n這樣想著，在這海岬，\n國家的海岬，神靈的海岬之上，\n一上一下，輕盈地邁著步伐，\n柔軟地扭動腰肢，四處奔走，用沉重的語氣，\n彷彿折斷堅硬的木片般，喊著：「Pau, pau！」\n讚美著暴風雨的魔鬼。\n就在這時，奧基基里姆伊射出的箭飛了過來，\n正好刺中我的衣領。\n從那以後，我就不知道發生了什麼。\n當我醒來時，\n天氣非常好，海上\n一片遼闊，沒有奧基基里姆伊的漁船的蹤影。\n發生了什麼事？從我的頭頂\n到我的腳趾，都像雁皮燃燒收縮般疼痛。\n我從未想過人類射出的小箭會如此折磨我，\n然後，我痛苦地扭動著，\n在這海岬，國家的海岬，神靈的海岬\n之上，一上一下，哭喊著，\n痛苦地扭動著，白天黑夜，活著\n死去，我不知道\n發生了什麼。\n當我醒來時，\n我正處於一隻巨大的黑狐的耳朵之間。\n兩天后，奧基基里姆伊以神靈般的姿態\n來到這裡，笑著說，\n「多麼美麗啊！守護著\n國家的海岬，神靈的海岬的黑狐神，\n擁有一顆善良的心，一顆神聖的心，\n所以他死得如此美麗。」\n說著，他取下我的頭，\n帶回他的家，用我的上顎骨\n作為他廁所的地基，用我的下顎骨\n作為他妻子的廁所的基石，\n我的身體就這樣與泥土一同腐爛了。\n從那以後，日日夜夜，\n在惡臭中痛苦掙扎，我死得毫無價值，死得很慘。\n我不僅僅是一個地位低下的神，\n而且因為我擁有一顆極其邪惡的心，所以我死得毫無用處，死得很慘，\n所以從今以後，你們這些狐狸，千萬\n不要心懷邪惡。\n\n狐狸神這樣講述著這個故事。","title":"狐之歌","comment":"從日文翻譯成中文，準確地保留了原文的含義。採用了講故事和詩意的語氣。","agent":"Retranslation_Chinese_Agent","text_type":"MAIN
