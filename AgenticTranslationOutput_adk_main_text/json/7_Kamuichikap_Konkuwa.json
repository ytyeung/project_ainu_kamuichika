        "translation": "The Owl God's Own Song\n         \"Konkwa\"\n\n\"Konkuwa,\nIn the past, when I spoke, it was like the sound of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark,\nresonating from the center of the bow.\nBut now I am weakened and old.\nHowever, if there is someone eloquent and\nconfident as a messenger,\nI would like to send them to Heaven for a five-and-a-half negotiation.\"\nAs I said this, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\nsomeone at the entrance said,\n\"Who else but me is eloquent as a messenger\nand full of confidence?\"\nLooking, it was a young crow.\nI let him into the house, and then, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\nI told the young crow the details of the mission,\nThree days passed, and as I was explaining the third point,\nI saw the young crow dozing off by the hearth.\nSeeing this, I was enraged and\nslapped the young crow with his wings and killed him.\nThen again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\n\"If there is anyone confident as a messenger,\nI would like to send them to Heaven with a mission worth five and a half.\"\nAs I said this, someone again at the entrance said,\n\"Who else but me is so eloquent,\nEnough to stand as a messenger to Heaven?\"\nLooking, it was a jay from the mountains.\nI let him into the house, and then again,\ntapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\nI explained the mission worth five and a half.\nFour days passed, and as I was explaining the fourth task,\nthe jay from the mountains was dozing off by the hearth.\nI became very angry and slapped the jay from the mountains with his wings and\nkilled him.\nThen again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\n\"If there is anyone eloquent, confident as a messenger,\nI would like to have them take the five-and-a-half negotiation to Heaven.\"\nAs I said this, someone\ncame in with a respectful attitude, and looking, it was\na young river crow, beautiful in appearance,\nwho sat on the left seat. So I,\ntapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\ncontinued to explain the five and a half tasks\nday and night. Looking,\nthe young river crow showed no sign of fatigue\nand listened, counting the days and nights,\nand on the sixth day,\nas I finished speaking, he immediately went out\nthrough the skylight and went to Heaven.\nThe gist of the mission was that in the human world,\nthere was a famine and the humans were on the verge of\nstarvation. Investigating the reason,\nit turned out that in Heaven,\nthe god who governs deer and the god who governs fish\nhad consulted and decided not to send deer or fish.\nNo matter how much the humans pleaded, they pretended not to know,\nso when the humans went hunting\nin the mountains, there were no deer, and when they went fishing\nin the rivers, there were no fish.\nI was angry when I saw this, so\nI dispatched a messenger to the deer god and the fish god\nto negotiate.\nAfter many days,\nA faint sound was heard in the sky,\nand someone came in. Looking, it was\nthe young river crow, now even more beautiful than before,\nadorned with brave dignity,\nwho began to state the counter-argument.\nThe reason why the deer god and the fish god of Heaven\nhad not released deer or fish until today\nwas that when humans caught deer,\nthey hit the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,\nthey discarded the deer's head as it was in the mountain forest.\nWhen they caught fish,\nthey killed them by hitting their heads with rotten wood,\nso the deer, crying naked,\nreturned to the deer god's side, and the fish\nreturned to the fish god with rotten wood in their mouths. The deer god and the fish god\nwere angry and consulted, and decided not to release deer or\nfish. But if from now on\nhumans treat deer and fish\nwith care, then they will release deer\nand release fish, the deer god and\nthe fish god said, he stated in detail.\nAfter hearing that, I presented\npraise to the young river crow, and saw that indeed\nthe humans had treated deer and fish\ncrudely.\nFrom then on, in order to prevent such things from happening again,\nI taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,\nand the humans also\nrealized that they were wrong, and from then on,\nthey made fishing tools as beautifully as making *nusa*,\nand used them to catch fish. When they caught a deer, they also decorated the deer's head\nbeautifully and performed rituals, so\nthe fish happily held the beautiful *gohei* in their mouths\nand went to the fish god, and the deer\nhappily combed their new *sakayaki* and returned to the deer god.\nThe deer god and\nthe fish god were very happy,\nand released a lot of fish, and released a lot of deer.\nThe humans now have no difficulties,\nno hunger, and live happily,\nI was relieved to see this.\nI am old and weakened,\nso I was going to go to Heaven,\nbut I could not go without concern because there was a famine in the human country that I was protecting and the humans were about to starve to death,\nso I have been here until now, but now I have\nno worries, so I will leave the strongest\nyoung hero behind me to protect the human world,\nand today I am going to Heaven.\"\nAnd so, the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the country,\ntold the story and went to Heaven.",
