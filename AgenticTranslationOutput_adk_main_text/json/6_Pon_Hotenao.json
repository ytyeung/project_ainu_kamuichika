    "chinese_translation": "小狼神親自吟唱的歌謠\n「霍特瑙」\n\n霍特瑙\n某日，我因百般無聊而來到海邊，\n正在玩耍時，來了一個小矮人，\n我便往河下游走去，\n他也跟著我往河下游走，\n我往河上游去，他也跟著我往河上游，擋住了我的去路。\n這樣往河下游六次，\n往河上游六次之後，小矮人\n終於按捺不住，面露怒色地說道：\n「匹伊匹伊\n你這小鬼，壞小鬼，要是你再這樣做，\n就說說看這海岬的，過去的名字和現在的名字。」\n我聽了，笑著回答\n說：\n「誰會不知道這海岬的過去的名字和\n現在的名字呢！\n從前，因為有尊貴偉大的神明和人類居住於此，\n所以這海岬被稱為神之海岬，\n但現在時代衰落了，\n所以被稱為御幣之海岬！」\n聽我說完，小矮人說道：\n「匹伊頓，匹伊頓\n你這小鬼，如果你真的那麼厲害，\n就說說看這條河以前的名字和現在的名字。」\n聽了之後，我回答說：\n「誰會不知道這條河以前的名字和\n現在的名字呢！\n從前，在那個偉大的時代，這條河被稱為\n水流湍急的河，\n但現在世道衰敗了，所以被稱為水流緩慢的河。」\n聽我說完，小矮人說道：\n「匹伊頓頓，匹伊頓頓\n如果你真的那麼厲害，\n我們就來互相揭露底細吧。」\n聽了之後，我回答說：\n「誰會不知道你的底細呢！\n很久以前，歐奇奇里穆伊去山上\n建造狩獵小屋時，用榛木做了爐緣，\n那爐緣被火烤得乾燥。\n歐奇奇里穆伊一踩一頭，另一頭就\n翹起來，歐奇奇里穆伊對此感到惱火，\n就把那爐緣拿到河邊\n丟掉了。\n之後，那爐緣就順著河流漂流，\n流到海裡，神明們看見它被遠方的海浪，近處的海浪\n拍打的樣子，\n認為尊貴偉大的歐奇奇里穆伊親手製作的東西竟然如此\n毫無用處地漂流，最終與海水一同腐爛，實在是\n太可惜了，於是神明們\n將那爐緣變成了魚，\n並命名為爐緣魚。\n然而，那爐緣魚因為不知道自己的身世，\n所以化為人形四處遊蕩。\n那爐緣魚就是你。」\n聽我說完，小矮人臉色\n大變，\n「匹伊頓頓，匹伊頓頓！\n你，是隻小小的，狼崽子\n啊。」\n話音剛落，就立刻撲通一聲跳進海裡。\n我目送著他，只見一條紅色的魚\n擺動著尾鰭，一直往遠方\n游去。\n幼狼神這樣講述著。",
