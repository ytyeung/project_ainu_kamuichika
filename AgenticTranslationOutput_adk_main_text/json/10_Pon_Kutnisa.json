    "japanese_text": "小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡\n「クツニサ クトンクトン」\n\nクツニサ クトンクトン\nある日に水源の方へ遊びに\n出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が\n胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに\n腰を曲げ曲げしている.\n私を見ると,いう事には,\n「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」\nという.見ると,胡桃の簗\nなものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水\nが流れて来て鮭どもが\n上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので\n泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので\n小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を\n引ったくり小男の腰の央を\n私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の\n腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい\n地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を\n揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の\n彼方まで届いている様だ.\nそれから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を\n出して,その杭を根本から\n折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.\n水源から清い風,清い水が\n流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.\n鮭どもは清い風,清い水に\n気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び\nながら,パチャパチャと\n上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし\n流れに沿うて帰って来た.と\n小さいオキキリムイが物語った.",
