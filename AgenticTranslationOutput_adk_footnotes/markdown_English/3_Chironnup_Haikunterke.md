### Translation 1

(1) pau: Onomatopoeia for the sound of a fox's cry.
(2) pushtotta: A bag-like item used when going out to sea for hunting, containing fire-making tools, medicines, and other necessary small items. Similar items for the same purpose include piuchiop and karop, but these are made from bulrush or attush weaving, so they are used on land. pushtotta is made from bear skin, seal skin, or other fur, making it waterproof and suitable for taking to sea.
(3) noya ai: Mugwort arrow. Mugwort is a revered plant among the Ainu. It is said that demons fear being struck by a mugwort arrow because they cannot float, making it an essential item when traveling far.
(4) Originally, men's and women's toilets were separate. ashinru and eosineru both refer to toilets.
Among foxes, the black fox is considered the most sacred. Capes protruding into the sea are generally the territory of black foxes, and it is said that black foxes do not make their voices heard to people unless something very serious is happening.
Okikurumi (Okikirmui), Samayunkur, and Shupunramka are cousins, with Shupunramka being the oldest and Okikirmui the youngest. Shupunramka is a gentle and introverted person, so there is nothing to tell about him, but Samayunkur is short-tempered, unwise, hasty, cowardly, and mean-spirited, while Okikirmui is wise like a god, compassionate, and courageous, so there are countless stories about him.

(2) pushtotta: A bag-like item used when going out to sea for hunting, to carry fire-making tools, medicines, and other small necessities. Similar items for the same purpose include piuchiop and karop, but these are made from cattail mats or attush weaving, so they are used on land. pushtotta is made from bear skin, seal skin, or other fur, making it waterproof and suitable for bringing to the sea.
(3) noya ai: Arrow of Artemisia. Artemisia is a grass respected by the Ainu. It is said that being struck by an arrow of Artemisia makes it impossible to float, so demons fear it most, and it is counted as one of the necessities when traveling far.
(4) Originally, men's and women's toilets were separate. ashinru and eosineru both mean toilet.
Among foxes, the black fox is considered the most noble. Capes protruding into the sea are mostly the territory of black foxes, and it is said that a black fox will not let people hear its voice unless something very serious happens.
Okikurumi (Okikirmui), Samayunkur, and Shupunramka are cousins, with Shupunramka being the oldest and Okikirmui being the youngest.
