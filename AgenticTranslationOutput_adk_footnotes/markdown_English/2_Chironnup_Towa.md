### Translation 1
```
(1) isoeonkami: iso means marine products, eonkami means to thank for something.
It is believed that when a whale is washed ashore, the Great God of the Sea brings it himself to give to humans and washes it ashore. At that time, important people dress up and worship facing the sea.
(2) ononno: These are the words spoken by people who welcome hunters returning from hunting in the mountains or at sea with their prey.
(3) uniwente: A ritual performed after a major flood, fire, volcanic eruption, or other natural disasters, or when a person is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to any unusual event.
At that time, words of condolence are exchanged while pointing the tips of spears and swords at each other. When a disaster victim appears in one village, many representatives from neighboring villages gather in that village to perform the ritual, but it can also be done by one person.
(4) hokokse: A man's cry for help from God during uniwente or when a terrible event occurs. It's "Hoho-hoi," and this is limited to men.
(5) ashur means strange story, ek means to come.
...It refers to when a messenger comes from a place far from the village to inform the person's hometown that someone who went on a trip has become ill or died, or when someone comes to the village to report that someone has died in another village or that something strange has happened.
The messenger is called ashurkorkur (a person with a strange story).
When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they first shout loudly hokokse (Hoho-hoi). Then, the villagers who hear it also shout loudly and greet him at the edge of the village to hear the strange story.
(6) uchishkar: Crying together. This is a woman's greeting, when they meet after a long separation, when a close relative dies, or when someone has been in great danger and barely escaped, women hold hands or hug each other's heads or shoulders and cry.
(7) matrimimse (a woman's cry): In case of a sudden change or in the case of uniwente, men make a loud voice like hokokse (Hoho-hoi), but women shout in a thin voice, "Hoi."
It is said that women's voices are higher and stronger than men's voices, so they reach the ears of the gods first. Therefore, when a sudden change occurs, even men make a thin voice like women and shout two or three times.
(8) peutanke: It has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, and rimimse is a slightly difficult word.
```
#### Comments
Translation 1: Pros: Generally accurate and understandable. Cons: Some phrases are slightly awkward and could be more natural. The explanation of 'isoeonkami' is not as precise as in Translation 2.

#### Translation 2
```
(1) isoeonkami. iso refers to marine products, eonkami refers to... apologizing for something.
It is believed that when a whale is stranded on the shore, it is the sea deity bringing it and pushing it ashore as a gift to humans. Therefore, at such times, respected individuals would dress formally and offer prayers facing the open sea.
(2) ononno. These are words spoken in unison by people welcoming those returning from hunting in the mountains or at sea with their catch.
(3) uniwente... A ritual performed after major disasters such as floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, or in cases where someone has been eaten by a bear, fallen into the sea or river, or been injured or died due to any unusual event.
During this ritual, people exchange words of condolence while pointing the tips of spears or swords at each other. When a village has suffered a disaster, many representatives from neighboring villages gather to perform the ritual, even if it is just one person from each village.
(4) hokokse... A male cry for help to the gods during uniwente or when a major unusual event has occurred. It is "フオホホーイ" and is limited to men.
(5) ashur refers to unusual news, ek means coming.
... This refers to when someone traveling far from the village becomes ill or dies, and a messenger is sent from that place to inform their hometown of the incident, or when someone comes to the village from another village to report the death of someone or the occurrence of some unusual event.
The messenger is called ashurkorkur (the person carrying the unusual news).
When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they first shout loudly hokokse (フオホホーイ). Upon hearing this, the villagers also shout loudly and go to the edge of the village to greet them and inquire about the unusual news.
(6) uchishkar... Crying together. This is a greeting among women, such as when they meet after a long separation, when a close relative has died, or when someone has narrowly escaped a great danger. Women hold hands or embrace each other's heads or shoulders and cry.
(7) matrimimse (a woman's cry)... In case of an emergency or uniwente, men shout hokokse (フオホホーイ) in a thick voice, while women cry hooi in a thin voice.
It is said that women's voices are higher and louder than men's voices, so they reach the ears of the gods first. Therefore, in the event of a sudden incident, even men will make a thin voice like women and shout two or three times.
(8) peutanke... Has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, while rimimse is a slightly more difficult word.
```
#### Comments
Translation 2: Pros: Very accurate and easy to understand. The language is natural and clear. Cons: The phrase 'apologizing for something' in the first sentence could be more specific.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is better because it is more accurate and easier to understand. The language used is more natural and clear compared to Translation 1. It also provides a more nuanced explanation of the Ainu terms.
