### Translation 1
```
(1) Amatsupo (Doishiyumi): Setting up a "trick bow."
(2) Swords. These are different from the swords used in war; they are usually hung above the treasures piled up on the right side of the house. They are not used in times of war, but they are used during uniwente, etc.
```
#### Comments
The translation is accurate and easy to understand. It maintains the original meaning of the Japanese text. However, the phrase 'uniwente, etc.' could be more specific.

#### Translation 2
```
(1) Amatsupo (crossbow): This refers to setting up a "trick bow."
(2) Swords: These are different from the swords used in war. Normally, they are hung on the right side of the house, above the pile of treasures. They are not used in war, but they are used in ceremonies such as uniwente.
```
#### Comments
This translation is very accurate and easy to understand. It provides a slightly more detailed description of where the swords are hung and uses more modern English. The term 'crossbow' is also a good clarification.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is better because it provides a more complete and clear description, especially regarding the location of the swords and the clarification of 'Amatsupo' as 'crossbow'. It is also very easy to understand and accurately reflects the original meaning.
