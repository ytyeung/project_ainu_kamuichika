### Translation 1
```
(1) kinatantuka...... A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into mats, but if you try to weave them when they are completely dry, it won't work, so you need to moisten them a little before using them. In this story, the woman is probably taking them to the river for that purpose.
(2) i-okapushpa. People greatly dislike saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in everyday conversation, which is called i-okapushpa. Also, digging up things that people have been hiding and telling everyone, or bringing up past actions of that person that are difficult for them to hear, is also called i-okapushpa.
(3) nimakitara...... Baring its fangs. This refers to a dog. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them, but being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most frightening thing, so they give the dog this name out of fear.

(3) nimakitara......Exposing fangs. This refers to dogs. Mountain animals are most afraid of being attacked by dogs showing their teeth when people go hunting with dogs, so they give dogs such a name to express their fear.
