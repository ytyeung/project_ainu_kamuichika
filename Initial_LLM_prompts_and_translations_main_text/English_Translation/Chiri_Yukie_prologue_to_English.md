序

その昔この広い北海道は，私たちの先祖の自由の天地でありました．天真爛漫な稚児の様に，美しい大自然に抱擁されてのんびりと楽しく生活していた彼等は，真に自然の寵児，なんという幸福な人だちであったでしょう．
冬の陸には林野をおおう深雪を蹴って，天地を凍らす寒気を物ともせず山又山をふみ越えて熊を狩り，夏の海には涼風泳ぐみどりの波，白い鴎の歌を友に木の葉の様な小舟を浮べてひねもす魚を漁り，花咲く春は軟らかな陽の光を浴びて，永久に囀さえずる小鳥と共に歌い暮して蕗ふきとり蓬よもぎ摘み，紅葉の秋は野分に穂揃うすすきをわけて，宵まで鮭とる篝かがりも消え，谷間に友呼ぶ鹿の音を外に，円まどかな月に夢を結ぶ．嗚呼なんという楽しい生活でしょう．平和の境，それも今は昔，夢は破れて幾十年，この地は急速な変転をなし，山野は村に，村は町にと次第々々に開けてゆく．
太古ながらの自然の姿も何時の間にか影薄れて，野辺に山辺に嬉々として暮していた多くの民の行方も亦いずこ．僅かに残る私たち同族は，進みゆく世のさまにただ驚きの眼をみはるばかり．しかもその眼からは一挙一動宗教的感念に支配されていた昔の人の美しい魂の輝きは失われて，不安に充ち不平に燃え，鈍りくらんで行手も見わかず，よその御慈悲にすがらねばならぬ，あさましい姿，おお亡びゆくもの……それは今の私たちの名，なんという悲しい名前を私たちは持っているのでしょう．
その昔，幸福な私たちの先祖は，自分のこの郷土が末にこうした惨めなありさまに変ろうなどとは，露ほども想像し得なかったのでありましょう．
時は絶えず流れる，世は限りなく進展してゆく．激しい競争場裡に敗残の醜をさらしている今の私たちの中からも，いつかは，二人三人でも強いものが出て来たら，進みゆく世と歩をならべる日も，やがては来ましょう．それはほんとうに私たちの切なる望み，明暮あけくれ祈っている事で御座います．
けれど……愛する私たちの先祖が起伏す日頃互いに意を通ずる為に用いた多くの言語，言い古し，残し伝えた多くの美しい言葉，それらのものもみんな果敢なく，亡びゆく弱きものと共に消失せてしまうのでしょうか．おおそれはあまりにいたましい名残惜しい事で御座います．
アイヌに生れアイヌ語の中に生いたった私は，雨の宵，雪の夜，暇ある毎に打集って私たちの先祖が語り興じたいろいろな物語の中極く小さな話の一つ二つを拙ない筆に書連ねました．
私たちを知って下さる多くの方に読んでいただく事が出来ますならば，私は，私たちの同族祖先と共にほんとうに無限の喜び，無上の幸福に存じます．

## Preface

Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was the realm of freedom for our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. Truly, they were nature's darlings, such blessed people they were.

In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the forests, braving the freezing air that chilled the earth, crossing mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they sailed their leaf-like boats on the green waves where cool breezes swam, the songs of white gulls their companions, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending their days singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the crimson autumn, they parted the fields of pampas grass, whose ears swayed in the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon faded into the evening. With the calls of deer echoing through the valleys, they dreamt beneath the round moon. Ah, what a joyous life!

That peaceful world is now a thing of the past. Decades have passed since those dreams were shattered. This land has undergone rapid transformation, with mountains and fields gradually giving way to villages, and villages to towns.

Before we knew it, the ancient face of nature has faded, and where have all the people who once lived joyfully in the fields and mountains gone? The few of our kin who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Yet, the beautiful souls of those ancient people, whose every action was governed by religious sentiment, are now gone from their eyes, replaced by anxiety and resentment, dulled and clouded, unable to see the way forward. They must rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now. What a sorrowful name we bear.

In the past, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state.

Time flows ceaselessly, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of the defeated in this fierce arena of competition, perhaps someday two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our ardent hope, and we pray for it morning and night.

But... will all the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other daily, the ancient and beautiful words they passed down, all disappear along with the perishing weak? Oh, that is too heartbreaking and regrettable.

Born an Ainu and raised within the Ainu language, I have written down in clumsy prose one or two of the very small stories from the many tales our ancestors used to gather and enjoy on rainy evenings and snowy nights whenever I had some free time.

If many who know us can read this, I, along with our ancestors, will truly feel boundless joy and supreme happiness.
