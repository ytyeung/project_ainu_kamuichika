### Prompt
```
You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of English translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern and simple English for easy understanding. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) katken......川ガラス.昔から大そういい鳥として尊ばれる鳥です.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) katken......River Dipper. It is a bird that has been highly respected as a very good bird since ancient times.


This is the English Translation 2.
katken: River Glass. It has been regarded as a very auspicious bird since ancient times.

```

### Output
```
(1) katken......River Dipper. This bird has been highly respected as an auspicious bird since ancient times.

Analysis of the two translations:

Translation 1:
Pros: More literal and provides a clearer explanation of why the bird is important.
Cons: "River Dipper" might not be immediately recognizable to all readers. The phrase "very good bird" is a bit awkward.

Translation 2:
Pros: Uses the more evocative term "River Glass" (though less accurate). "Auspicious bird" is a more sophisticated way of saying "good bird."
Cons: Less literal translation of "川ガラス". Doesn't explicitly state the reason for the bird's importance.

Choice of Better Translation: Translation 1 is slightly better because it prioritizes accuracy. However, it can be improved by incorporating elements from Translation 2.
