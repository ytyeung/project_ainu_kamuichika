You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of English translations at hand.

1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern and simple English for easy understanding. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) kinatantuka......蒲の束.蒲は編んで筵の様な敷物にするのですが,よく乾いているのをそのまま編むといけませんから,少し湿してからつかいます.この話にあるのも,そのために女が川へ持って行くのでしょう.
(2) i-okapushpa.人は死んでしまった親や親類などの名を言ったり,その事をふだん話したりする事を i-okapushpa と言って大へん嫌います.また,人のかくしていた事をそばからほじり出して,みんなに言ったり,その人の聞きにくい様なその人の前の行為などを口に出したりする事をも i-okapushpa と言います.
(3) nimakitara......牙の剥き出している.これは犬の事.山のけものたちは,人が猟に行くと犬を連れて行きますが,その犬に歯をむき出してかかられるのが一ばん恐いので,犬にこんな名をつけて恐がっています.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) kinatantuka...... A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into mats and other coverings, but if you try to weave them when they are completely dry, it won't work well. So, they are slightly moistened before use. In this story, the woman is probably taking them to the river for that purpose.

(2) i-okapushpa. People greatly dislike saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in everyday conversation, which is called *i-okapushpa*. Also, digging up things that people have kept hidden and telling everyone, or bringing up past actions that are difficult for the person to hear, especially in front of them, is also called *i-okapushpa*.

(3) nimakitara...... Baring its fangs. This refers to a dog. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them, and being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most frightening thing. Therefore, they give dogs this kind of name out of fear.


This is the English Translation 2.
(1) kinatantuka......A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into a mat-like bedding. However, dry cattails cannot be woven directly, so they need to be slightly moistened before use. In this story, the woman probably brought the cattails to the river for this reason.

(2) i-okapushpa. People highly avoid saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in general. This is called i-okapushpa. In addition, digging up someone's hidden secrets and telling everyone, or revealing their embarrassing past actions, is also called i-okapushpa.

(3) nimakitara......Baring fangs. This refers to dogs. Hunters in the mountains bring dogs when hunting. Being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most terrifying thing, so dogs are called by this name to express fear.

Here's a comparison of the two translations, a choice of the better one, and a revised translation incorporating the best aspects of both.

**Analysis of Translations:**

**(1) kinatantuka**

    *   **Pros:** More specific with "mat-like bedding".
    *   **Cons:** None significant.
*   **Choice:** Translation 2 is slightly better due to its specificity.

**(2) i-okapushpa**
*   **Translation 1:**
    *   **Pros:** Includes the nuance of speaking about the deceased in everyday conversation.
    *   **Cons:** Slightly wordy.
*   **Translation 2:**
    *   **Pros:** More concise.
    *   **Cons:** Loses some of the nuance of Translation 1.
*   **Choice:** Translation 1 is better because it captures more of the original meaning.

**(3) nimakitara**
*   **Translation 1:**
    *   **Pros:** Clear and direct.
    *   **Cons:** None significant.
*   **Translation 2:**
    *   **Pros:** "to express fear" adds a bit more context.
    *   **Cons:** None significant.

**Overall Choice:**
I will primarily use Translation 1 as the base, incorporating elements from Translation 2 where they improve clarity or accuracy.
