### Prompt

You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of English translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern and simple English for easy understanding. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) achikara......「きたない」.おかしい,生意気なという意味をふくむ.
この物語は Okikirmui の父と pon nitnekamui の父とは,前に大層激しい戦争をしたことがあるので,この pon okikirmui と pon nitnekamui とは敵どうしになっています.その親たちの戦争した模様は別な物語に詳しく出ています.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) achikara...... "kitanai" [dirty]. Includes meanings such as strange, impertinent.

In this story, the father of Okikirmui and the father of pon nitnekamui had a very fierce war in the past, so this pon okikirmui and pon nitnekamui are enemies. The details of the war between their parents are described in detail in another story.


This is the English Translation 2.
(1) achikara......means "dirty." It carries a sense of strangeness and arrogance.
In this story, Okikirmui's father and pon nitnekamui's father had a very fierce war before, so pon okikirmui and pon nitnekamui are in a hostile relationship. The details of their fathers' war are described in detail in another story.

```

### Output
```
(1) achikara......means "dirty" (kitanai). It also implies strangeness and impertinence.

In this story, Okikirmui's father and pon nitnekamui's father had a very fierce war in the past. As a result, pon okikirmui and pon nitnekamui are enemies. The details of their fathers' war are described in detail in another story.

Analysis of the two translations:

Translation 1:
Pros: Directly provides the Japanese word "kitanai" and its literal translation "dirty," which can be helpful for understanding the nuance. It also explicitly states that "achikara" includes multiple meanings.
Cons: Uses somewhat awkward phrasing like "Includes meanings such as strange, impertinent." The sentence structure in the second paragraph is a bit clunky.

Translation 2:
Pros: More natural and fluent English. The phrasing is more concise and easier to understand.
Cons: Doesn't explicitly provide the Japanese word "kitanai." The explanation of "achikara" is slightly less detailed.

Choice of Better Translation:
Translation 2 is slightly better because of its clarity and natural flow. Accuracy is comparable between the two.

Improvements:
Combining the strengths of both translations, we can create a more accurate and understandable version.
