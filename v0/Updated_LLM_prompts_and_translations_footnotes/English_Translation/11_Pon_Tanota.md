### Prompt
```
You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of English translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern and simple English for easy understanding. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) iwan poknashir......六つの地獄.地の下には六段の世界があってそこには種々な悪魔が住んでいます.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) iwan poknashir......Six Hells. Beneath the earth, there are six levels, and various demons dwell there.


This is the English Translation 2.
iwan poknashir......Six Hells. There are six layers of worlds beneath the ground, inhabited by all kinds of demons.

```

### Output
```
iwan poknashir......Six Hells. Beneath the ground, there are six layers of worlds, inhabited by all kinds of demons.

Analysis of the two translations:

Translation 1 Pros:
*   Simple and direct.

Translation 1 Cons:
*   Slightly less descriptive.

Translation 2 Pros:
*   More descriptive, using "layers of worlds" to convey the meaning of "六段の世界".
*   "all kinds of demons" is a good translation of "種々な悪魔".

Translation 2 Cons:
*   Slightly more verbose.

Choice of Better Translation:
Translation 2 is slightly better because it provides a more descriptive and nuanced translation of the original Japanese text, especially with "layers of worlds" and "all kinds of demons."

Updated Translation Rationale:
I will combine the strengths of both translations to create a final version that is both accurate and easy to understand. I will use the descriptive elements from Translation 2 while maintaining the simplicity of Translation 1.
