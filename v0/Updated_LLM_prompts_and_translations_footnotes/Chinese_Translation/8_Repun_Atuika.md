You are translating the following Japanese text into Chinese. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of Chinese translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two Chinese translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into Chinese again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern Chinese for easy understanding. Display in Traditional Chinese. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).

This is the Chinese Translation 1.
(1) 以御幣裝飾之物,於向神明獻上神酒時使用。此 kike-ush-pashui 擔任人類的代理,據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui(酒宴用筷)。


This is the Chinese Translation 2.
這是一種用*gohei*（紙垂）裝飾的飾品，用於向神靈供奉清酒。這種*kike-ush-pashui*作為人類的代表，據說會去到神靈那裡，並傳達人類想對他們說的話。沒有*gohei*的普通筷子被稱為*iku pashui*（宴會用筷子）。

```

### Output
```
這是一種用御幣(*gohei*)裝飾的物品，用於向神靈供奉神酒時使用。這種*kike-ush-pashui*作為人類的代表，據說會將人類想對神靈說的話傳達給神靈。沒有御幣(*gohei*)裝飾的普通筷子被稱為*iku pashui*（宴會用筷）。

Analysis of the two Chinese translations:

Translation 1:
Pros: More literal translation, closely follows the original Japanese sentence structure.
Cons: Less natural in modern Chinese, uses somewhat archaic terms like "御幣裝飾之物" and "向神明獻上神酒時". The term *kike-ush-pashui* and *iku pashui* are not kept in original form.

Translation 2:
Pros: More natural and easier to understand in modern Chinese. Keeps the terms *gohei*, *kike-ush-pashui* and *iku pashui* in original form.
Cons: Slightly less literal, uses "紙垂" to explain *gohei* which might not be accurate. 

Choice of Better Translation:
Translation 2 is better because it is easier to understand and retains the original terms, which is important for cultural context. Accuracy is maintained while improving readability.

Updated Translation Strategy:
Incorporate the literal accuracy of Translation 1 where it doesn't compromise readability. Keep the terms *kike-ush-pashui* and *iku pashui* in original form. Use more modern and accessible language.
