    "japanese_translation": "(1) kinatantuka......蒲の束.蒲は編んで筵の様な敷物にするのですが,よく乾いているのをそのまま編むといけませんから,少し湿してからつかいます.この話にあるのも,そのために女が川へ持って行くのでしょう.\n(2) i-okapushpa.人は死んでしまった親や親類などの名を言ったり,その事をふだん話したりする事を i-okapushpa と言って大へん嫌います.また,人のかくしていた事をそばからほじり出して,みんなに言ったり,その人の聞きにくい様なその人の前の行為などを口に出したりする事をも i-okapushpa と言います.\n(3) nimakitara......牙の剥き出している.これは犬の事.山のけものたちは,人が猟に行くと犬を連れて行きますが,その犬に歯をむき出してかかられるのが一ばん恐いので,犬にこんな名をつけて恐がっています.",
    "english_translation": "(1) kinatantuka...... A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into mats and other coverings, but if you try to weave them when they are completely dry, it won't work well. So, they are slightly moistened before use. In this story, the woman is probably taking them to the river for that purpose.\n\n(2) i-okapushpa. People greatly dislike saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in everyday conversation, which is called *i-okapushpa*. Also, digging up things that people have kept hidden and telling everyone, or bringing up past actions that are difficult for the person to hear, especially in front of them, is also called *i-okapushpa*.\n\n(3) nimakitara...... Baring its fangs. This refers to a dog. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them, and being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most frightening thing. Therefore, they give dogs this kind of name out of fear.\n",

    "english_translation_2": "(1) kinatantuka......A bundle of cattails. Cattails are woven into a mat-like bedding. However, dry cattails cannot be woven directly, so they need to be slightly moistened before use. In this story, the woman probably brought the cattails to the river for this reason.\n\n(2) i-okapushpa. People highly avoid saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in general. This is called i-okapushpa. In addition, digging up someone's hidden secrets and telling everyone, or revealing their embarrassing past actions, is also called i-okapushpa.\n\n(3) nimakitara......Baring fangs. This refers to dogs. Hunters in the mountains bring dogs when hunting. Being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most terrifying thing, so dogs are called by this name to express fear.",
