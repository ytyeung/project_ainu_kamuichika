    "update_comment": "The English translation is generally good but can be improved by incorporating some of the nuances present in the Japanese and reflected in the Chinese translation. Specifically, the English translation could benefit from a slightly more emotive tone in certain places, and a clearer indication of the women's actions being 'self-centered'.\n\nComparison:\n*   The Chinese translation often uses more descriptive language, adding emotional weight to the narrative. For example, \"毒辣的太陽曬得我待的地方都乾巴巴的，感覺快要死掉了\" (the fierce sun bakes the place where I dwell until it's dried up, I feel like I'm about to die) is more evocative than the English \"The fierce sun beats down, and the place where I dwell is dried up. I feel as though I am about to die.\"\n*   The Chinese translation explicitly states the first woman went to the mountain \"自顧自地\" (self-centeredly), which is implied but not directly stated in the English.\n*   The Chinese translation uses \"哭哭啼啼的\" (crying and sniveling) to describe the clams' crying, which adds more emotion than the English \"As we cried\".\n\nImprovements:\n*   Incorporate more descriptive language to enhance the emotional impact.\n*   Clarify the first woman's self-centeredness.\n*   Use more vivid language to describe the clams' distress.",
