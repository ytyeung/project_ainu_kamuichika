    "update_comment": "The English translation is generally good but can be improved by incorporating some elements from the Chinese translation to enhance clarity and emotional impact. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Title:** \"The Otter's Own Lament\" is a decent title, but the Chinese title \"水獺自述的悲歌\" (Otter's Self-Narrated Dirge/Elegy) carries a stronger sense of sorrow and self-reflection. Consider a title that reflects this.\n*   **Kappa Reu Reu Kappa:** The English translation simply repeats this. The Chinese translation retains the original sound. It might be helpful to add a note explaining that this is a chant or song.\n*   **Description of the sisters:** Both translations capture the beauty of the sisters. The Chinese translation uses \"美得像個神仙似的\" (beautiful as a goddess), which is very close to the English. No major changes needed here.\n*   **Otter's question:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.\n*   **The maiden's reaction:** The English translation captures the anger well. The Chinese translation uses \"臉上立刻閃過一絲怒氣\" (a flash of anger crossed her face), which is more vivid. Consider incorporating this.\n*   **The maiden's curse:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.\n*   **The dog attack:** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation uses \"對著我齜牙咧嘴\" (baring their fangs at me), which is more descriptive. Consider incorporating this.\n*   **Otter's escape and second encounter:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.\n*   **The final attack:** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation uses \"又咬又撕我的頭和身體\" (biting and tearing at my head and body), which is more vivid. Consider incorporating this.\n*   **The otter's realization:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.\n*   **The moral:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.\n*   **Final line:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation uses \"水獺這樣悲嘆著\" (the otter lamented thus), which is more impactful. Consider incorporating this.\n\nIn summary, the English translation is accurate but could benefit from incorporating some of the more vivid and emotionally resonant phrasing from the Chinese translation, particularly in describing the maiden's reaction, the dog attack, and the final line.",
