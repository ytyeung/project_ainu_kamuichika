狐が自ら歌った謡
「ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ」

ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ
国の岬,神の岬の上に
私は坐して居りました.
ある日に外へ出て見ますと
海は凪なぎてひろびろとしていて,海の上に
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカとサマユンクルが
海猟に三人乗りで出かけています,それを見た私は
私の持ってる悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上をずーっと上へずーっと下へ
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけ出しました.
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパーウ,パウと叫び
この川の水源をにらみにらみ暴風の魔を
呼びました.すると,それにつれてこの川の
水源から烈しい風,つむじ風が
吹き出して海にはいると直ぐに
この海は,上の海が下になり
下の海が上になりました.オキキリムイたち
の漁舟は沖の人の海と,陸の人の海との
出会ったところ(海の中程)に,非常な急変に会って波の間を
クルリと廻りました.大きな浪が山の様に
舟の上へかぶさり寄ります.すると,
オキキリムイ,サマユンクル,シュプンラムカは
声をふるって,舟を漕ぎました.
この小さい舟は落葉の飛ぶ様に吹き飛ばされ
今にもくつがえりそうになるけれども
感心にも人間たちは力強くて
この小舟は風の中に
波の上をすべります.
それを見ると私の持っている悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり,
重い調子で木片がポキリポキリと折れる様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔を声援するのみに精を出しました.
そうしてる中に,やっと,サマユンクルが
手の上から,手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれました.
そのさまを見て私はひそかに笑いを浮べました.
それからまた,精を出して
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
暴風の魔を声援しました.
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカと二人で
励まし合いながら勇ましく舟を漕いで
居りましたが,と,ある時シュプンラムカは
手の上から手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれてしまいました,それを見て
ひそかに私は笑いました.
それからまた軽い足取りで腰やわらかに
飛びまわり重い調子でかたい木片を
ポキリポキリと折る様に叫び精を出しました.
けれども,オキキリムイは疲れた様子は少しも無い.
一枚の薄物を体にまとい,
舟を漕いでいます,そのうちに
手の下でその持っていた楫、第3水準1-86-21)が折れてしまいました.
すると,疲れ死んだサマユンクルに
躍りかかりその持っている楫、第3水準1-86-21)をもぎとってたった一人で
舟を漕ぎました.
私はそれを見ると,持前の悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
重い調子でかたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
精を出して暴風の魔に声援しました.
そうしてるうちにサマユンクルの舵も
折れてしまいました.オキキリムイはシュプンラムカに
躍りかかりその※(「楫+戈」、第3水準1-86-21)をとって
勇ましく舟を漕ぎました.
けれども彼の※(「楫+戈」、第3水準1-86-21)も波に折られてしまいました.
そこで,オキキリムイは舟の中に
立ちつくして,烈しい風のうちに
まさか人間の彼が私を見つけようとは
思わなかったに,国の岬,神の岬の
上の,私の眼の央を見つめました.
今までやさしかった顔に怒りの色を
あらわして,鞄をいじっていたが
中から出したものを見ると,蓬よもぎの小弓と
蓬の小矢を取り出しました.
それを見てひそかに私は笑いました.
「人間なぞ何をしたって,恐い事があるものか,
あんな蓬の小矢は何に使うものだろう.」
と思ってこの岬
国の岬,神の岬の上を
ずーっと上へずーっと下へ軽い足取りで
腰やわらかにかけまわり,重い調子で
かたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔をほめたたえました.
その中にオキキリムイの射放した矢が飛んで来ましたが
ちょうど私の襟首えりくびのところへ突きささりました.
それっきりあとどうなったか解らなくなってしまいました.
ふと気がついて見ると
大そう好いお天気で,海の上は
広々として,オキキリムイの漁舟もなにもありません.
どうした事か私の頭のさきから
足のさきまで雁皮が燃え縮む様に痛みます.
まさか人間の射た小さな矢がこんなに私を苦しめ
ようとは思わなかったのに,それから手足をもがき苦しみ
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上を,ずーっと上へ,ずーっと下へ泣き叫びながら
もがき苦しみ,昼でも夜でも生きたり
死んだり,している中に,どうしたか
わからなくなりました.
ふと気がついて見ると,
大きな黒狐の耳と耳との間に私は居りました.
二日ほどたった時,オキキリムイが神様の様な様子で
やって来て,ニコニコ笑って言うことには,
「まあ見ばのよい事,国の岬,神の岬
の上を見守る黒狐の神様は,
善い心,神の心を持っていたから
死にざまの見ばのよい死方をしたのですね.」
言いながら私の頭を取って,
自分の家へ持って行き私の上顎の骨を
自分の便所のどだいとし,私の下顎を
その妻の便所の礎として,
私のからだはそのまま土と共に腐ってしまいました.
それから夜でも昼でも
悪い臭気に苦しんでいる中に私はつまらない死方,悪い
死方をしました.
ただの身分の軽い神でもなかったのですが
大変な悪い心を私は持っていた為なんにも
ならない,悪い死方を私はしたのですから
これからの狐たちよ,決して
悪い心を持ちなさるな.

と狐の神様が物語りました.

This is the English translation.
Listen closely, for I shall tell you a tale, a song sung by a fox-god of old:

"Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat in my divine repose.
One day, I ventured forth to gaze upon the world,
The sea was calm, stretching far and wide, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunkamka, and Samayunkur,
Ventured out on a sea hunt, three souls in a single boat.
And as I watched them, a wicked impulse stirred within my heart.

Across the cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with nimble feet and swaying hips, I darted.
With a heavy voice, like the snapping of dry twigs, I cried, "Pau, Pau!"
And I glared at the source of the river, summoning the demon of the storm.
And as I did, from the river's source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Burst forth and rushed into the sea, and in an instant,
The sea above became the sea below,
And the sea below rose to become the sea above.
Okikirmui and his companions,
Their fishing boat, caught between the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land,
Met with a sudden and violent change, spinning wildly amidst the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed down upon their boat.
Then Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunkamka,
Raised their voices and rowed with all their might.
The small boat was tossed about like a falling leaf,
On the verge of capsizing, yet,
Remarkably, the humans were strong,
And the little boat danced upon the waves,
Riding the wind.
Seeing this, the wicked impulse stirred within my heart once more.
With nimble feet and swaying hips, I darted about,
With a heavy voice, like the snapping of dry twigs, I cried, "Pau, Pau!"
And I devoted myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
And as I did, at last, Samayunkur,
Blood flowing from his hands, above and below,
Collapsed in exhaustion.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then, once more, I exerted myself,
With nimble feet and swaying hips, I darted about,
With a heavy voice, like the snapping of dry twigs, I cried,
And cheered on the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunkamka, the two of them,
Encouraged each other and rowed bravely on,
But then, at last, Shupunkamka,
Blood flowing from his hands, above and below,
Collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then, once more, with nimble feet and swaying hips,
I leaped about, with a heavy voice, like the snapping of dry twigs,
I cried out and exerted myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With only a thin garment wrapped around his body,
He continued to row, until,
The oar in his hand snapped.
Then, he leaped upon the exhausted Samayunkur,
And snatched the oar from his grasp, and rowed on alone.

Seeing this, the wicked impulse stirred within my heart once more.
With a heavy voice, like the snapping of dry twigs, I cried,
With nimble feet and swaying hips, I darted about,
And devoted myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
And as I did, Samayunkur's rudder, too,
Snapped. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunkamka,
And took his oar,
And rowed bravely on.
But his oar, too, was broken by the waves.
Then, Okikirmui stood in the boat,
Amidst the raging storm,
Never imagining that a mere human could see me,
He gazed into the center of my eyes, upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His gentle face now filled with anger,
He rummaged in his bag,
And from within, he drew forth a small bow of mugwort,
And a small arrow of mugwort.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
"What could a human possibly do to frighten me?
What use could such a mugwort arrow possibly be?"
And so, across the cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with nimble feet,
I darted about, with a heavy voice,
Like the snapping of dry twigs, I cried, "Pau, Pau!"
And praised the demon of the storm.
Then, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
And struck me right in the nape of my neck.
And from that moment on, I knew nothing more.
When I awoke,
The weather was fair, and the sea was
Vast and calm, and Okikirmui's fishing boat was nowhere to be seen.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, I felt a burning pain, as if the bark of a birch tree were shrinking.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human could cause me such torment.
And so, I writhed in agony,
Across the cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, crying out in pain,
Writhing in agony, living and dying,
Day and night, until, I knew nothing more.
When I awoke,
I was between the ears of a great black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui arrived, looking like a god,
And said with a smile,
"What a fine sight! The black fox god, watching over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Possessed a good heart, a divine heart,
And so, he died a beautiful death."
As he spoke, he took my head,
And carried it to his home, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jawbone
As the foundation of his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
And so, day and night,
Tormented by a foul stench, I died a meaningless, wretched death.
Though I was no mere low-ranking god,
Because I possessed such a wicked heart, I died a useless, wretched death.
Therefore, you foxes of the future, never, ever,
Harbor a wicked heart.

Thus spoke the fox-god, in his tale.

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,

The sea was calm, stretching far and wide, and upon it,

And as I did, from the river's source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Burst forth and rushed into the sea, and in an instant,
This sea, the sea above became the sea below,
And the sea below rose to become the sea above.
Okikirmui and his companions,
Their fishing boat, caught where the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land met,
Encountered a sudden and violent change, spinning wildly amidst the waves.

Collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then, once more, with light steps and swaying hips,
I leaped about, with a heavy voice, like the snapping of hard wood,
I cried out and exerted myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With only a thin garment wrapped around his body,
He continued to row, until,
The oar in his hand snapped.

The initial translation is generally good, but it can be improved by:

*   **More literal translation in some places:** Some phrases are paraphrased when a more direct translation would better capture the original's tone and imagery.
*   **Consistency:** The repetition in the original Japanese is important and should be reflected more consistently in the English translation. For example, the phrase "軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり" is translated differently in different places.
*   **Emphasis on Sound and Rhythm:** The original text is a chant, so the translation should try to capture some of the rhythm and sound qualities of the Japanese.
*   **Clarification of Specific Terms:** Some terms, like the repeated "国の岬,神の岬の上," could benefit from a more nuanced translation to convey their full meaning.
*   **Addressing Redundancy:** The phrase "悪い死方をしました" appears twice and can be simplified to avoid redundancy.
*   **Maintaining formality:** The original text is formal, so the translation should maintain a similar level of formality.
*   **More accurate translation of some words:** Some words are not translated accurately. For example, 蓬 is translated as mugwort, but it is actually artemisia.

Here is the updated translation.
