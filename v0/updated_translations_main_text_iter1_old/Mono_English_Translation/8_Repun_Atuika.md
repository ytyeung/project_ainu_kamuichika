海の神が自ら歌った謡「アトイカ
トマトマキ クントテアシ フム フム!」

アトイカ トマトマキ クントテアシ フムフム
長い兄様,六人の兄様,長い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様,短い姉様,六人の姉様が
私を育てて居たが,私は
宝物の積んである傍に高床をしつらえ,その高床の上に
すわって鞘さや刻み鞘彫り
それのみを
事として暮していた.
毎日,朝になると兄様たちは
矢筒を背負って姉様たちと一しょに出て行って
暮方になると疲れた顔色で
何も持たずに帰って来て姉様たちは
疲れているのに食事拵こしらえをし,私にお膳を出して
自分たちも食事をして食事のあとが片附くと,
それから兄様たちは矢を作るのに忙しく手を動かす.
矢筒が一ぱいになると,みんな疲れているものだから
寝ると高鼾たかいびきを響かせてねむってしまう.
その次の日になるとまだ暗い中に
みんな起きて姉様たちが食事拵えをして私に膳を出し
みんな食事が済むと,また矢筒を背負って
行ってしまう.また夕方になると
疲れた顔色で何も持たずに帰って来て
姉様たちは食事拵え,兄様たちは矢を作って,
何時いつでも同じ事をしていた.
ある日にまた兄様たち姉様たちは
矢筒を背負って出て行ってしまった.
宝物の彫刻を私はしていたがやがて
高床の上に起き上り金の小弓に
金の小矢を持って外へ出て
見ると海はひろびろと凪なぎて
海の東へ海の西へ鯨たちが
パチャパチャと遊んで居る.すると
海の東に長い姉様,六人の姉様が手をつらねて輪をつくると,
短い姉様,六人の姉様が,輪の中へ鯨を追い込む,
長い兄様,六人の兄様,短い兄様,六人の兄様が
輪の中へ鯨をねらい射つと,その鯨の
下を矢が通り上を矢が通る.
毎日毎日彼等はこんな事をして
いたのであった.見ると海の中央に
大きな鯨が親子の鯨が上へ下へ
パチャパチャと遊んで居るのが見えたので
遠い所から金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえてねらい射ったところ,一本の矢で
一度に親子の鯨を射貫いてしまった.
そこで一つの鯨のまんなかを斬って
その半分を姉様たちの輪の中へ
ほうりこんだ.それから鯨一ツ半の鯨を
尾の下にいれて人間の国に
むかって行きオタシュツ村に
着いて一ツ半の鯨を
村の浜へ押し上げてやった.
それから海の上にゆっくりと
游いで帰って
来たところが,誰かが
息を切らしてその側をはしるものがあるので
見ると,海のごめであった.
息をきらしながら云うことには,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
勇マシイ神様,大神様,
あなたはなんの為に,卑しい人間共,悪い人間共に
大きな海幸をおやりになったのです.
卑しい人間共,悪い人間共は,斧もて
鎌をもて大きな海幸をブツブツ切ったり突っついたり
削り取っています,勇ましい神様
大神様さあ早く大海幸を
お取り返しなさいませ.あんなに沢山,海幸をおやりに
なっても卑しい人間たち悪い人間たちは
有難いとも思わずこんな事をします.」
と云うので私は笑って云う
ことには,
「私は人間たちに呉れてやったものだから
今はもう自分の物だから,人間たちが
自分の持物を鎌でつつこうが斧で
削ろうがどうでも
自分たちの自由に食べたらいいではないか
それがどうなのだ.」と云うと
海のごめは所在無げにしているけれども
私はそれを少しも構わず海の上を
ゆっくりとおよいで
もう日が暮れようとしている時に,私の海へ
着いた.見ると
十二人の兄様,十二人の
姉様は,彼の半分の鯨をはこび
きれなくてみんなで掛声高く
海の東に,グズグズしている.
私は実にあきれてしまった.
私はそれに構わずに家へ
帰り,高床の上にすわった.
そこで後ふりかえって人間の世界の方を
見ると,私が打ち上げた一ツ
半の鯨のまわりをとりまいてりっぱな男たちや
りっぱな女たちが盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば歓び躍り,後の砂丘
の上にはりっぱな敷物が敷かれて
その上にオタシュツ村の村長が
六枚の着物に帯を束たばね,六枚の着物を
羽織って,りっぱな神の冠,先祖の冠を
頭に冠り,神授の剣を腰に佩はき
神の様に美しい様子で手を高くさし上げ
礼拝をしている.人間たちは泣いて
海幸をよろこんでいる.
何をごめが人間たちが
斧で鎌で私の押し上げた鯨を
突っついていると云ったが,
村長をはじめ
村民は,昔から
宝物の最も尊いものとしている神剣を取り出して
それで肉を斬って搬はこんでいる.
それから,私の兄様たち姉様たちは帰って来る
様子もない.
二日三日たった時,窗の方に
何か見える様だ,それで
振りかえって見て見ると,窗の上に
かねの盃にあふれる程
酒がはいっていてその上に
御幣を取りつけた酒箸が載っていて,
行きつ戻りつ,使者としての口上を述べて云うには,
「私はオタシュツ村の人で
畏れ多い事ながらおみきを差し上げます.」と
オタシュツ村の村長が村民
一同を代表して私に礼をのべる
次第をくわしく話し,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
大神様,勇ましい神様でなくて誰が,
この様に私たちの村に饑饉があって
もう,どうにも仕様がない程
食物に窮している時に哀れんで下されましょう.
私たちの村に生命を与えて下さいました事,
誠に有難う御座います,海幸をよろこび
少しの酒を作りまして,小さな幣ぬさを
添え,大神様に謝礼
申し上げる次第であります.」という事を
幣つきの酒箸が行きつ戻りつ申し立てた.
それで私は起き上って,かねの盃を
取り,押しいただいて
上の座の六つの酒樽の蓋ふたを開き
美酒を少しずつ入れて
かねの盃を窗の上にのせた.
それが済むと,高床の上に腰を下し
見ると彼の盃は箸と共に
なくなっていた.それから,鞘を刻み
鞘を彫り,していてやがて
ふと面をあげて見ると,
家の中は美しい幣で一ぱいになっていて
家の中は白い雲がたなびき白いいなびかりが
ピカピカ光っている.私はああ美しいと思った.
それからまた,二日三日たつと,
その時やっと,家のそとで,兄様たちや
姉様たちが掛声高く彼の鯨を
引っ張って来たのがきこえだした.私はあきれて
しまった.家の中へはいる様子を
眺めると,兄様たちや姉様たちは
たいへん疲れて,顔色も萎しおれている.
みんなはいって来て,沢山の幣を見ると,
驚いてみんななん遍もなん遍も拝した.
そのうちに,東の座の六つの酒樽は
溢れるばかりになって,神の好物の
酒の香が家の中に漂うた.
それから私は,美しい幣で家の中を飾りつけ,
遠方の神,近所の神を招待し
盛んな酒宴を張った.姉様たちは
鯨を煮て,神たちに出すと,
神たちは,舌鼓を打ってよろこんだ.
宴酣たけなわの頃私は起き上り
斯々かくかく,人間世界に饑饉があって
あわれに思い,海幸を打ち上げた次第や
人間たちをよくしてやると,悪い神々が
それをねたみ,海のごめが私に中
傷した事や,オタシュツ村の
村長が斯々の言葉をとって私に礼をのべ
幣つきの酒箸が使者になって来た事など
詳しく物語ると,神たちは
一度に揃って打ちうなずきつつ,
私をほめたたえた.
それからまた,盛な宴をはり
神たちの,そこに
ここに舞う音,躍る音は
美しき響をなし,姉様たちは
提子ちょうしを持って席の間を酌して
まわるもあり,女神たち
と共に美しい声で歌うもある.
二日三日たって宴を閉じた.
神々に美しい幣を二つ三つずつ
上げると神々は腰の央なかを
ギックリ屈めてなん遍もなん遍も礼をして,
みんな自分の家に立ち帰った.
そのあと,何時でも同じく長い兄様,六人の兄様
長い姉様,六人の姉様,短い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様と一しょにい,
人間たちが酒を造るとその度毎に
私に酒を送り私のところへ幣をよこす.
今はもう,人間たちも食物の不足も
なんの困る事も無く平穏に
暮しているので,私は安心をしています.

This is the English translation.
Atoika Tomatomaki Kuntoteashi Fumu Fumu!
Long brothers, six in number, long sisters, six in number,
Short brothers, six in number, short sisters, six in number,
They raised me, but I,
Beside the treasures piled high, built a raised platform, and upon that platform,
I sat, carving sheaths, engraving sheaths,
That alone
Was my life's pursuit.
Each day, as morning broke, my brothers,
Shouldering quivers, went out with my sisters,
And as evening fell, with weary faces,
They returned empty-handed, while my sisters,
Though weary, prepared the meal, set my place,
And after they ate and cleared away the dishes,
Then my brothers busied themselves, crafting arrows.
When the quivers were full, for they were all weary,
They slept, their loud snores echoing in the night.
The next day, while still dark,
They all arose, my sisters preparing the meal, setting my place,
And when all had eaten, they shouldered their quivers once more,
And departed. Again, as evening fell,
With weary faces, they returned empty-handed,
My sisters preparing the meal, my brothers crafting arrows,
Ever and always, they did the same.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters,
Shouldered their quivers and went away.
I was carving treasures, but soon,
I rose upon the raised platform, and with a golden bow,
And golden arrows, I went outside,
And saw the sea, vast and calm,
And to the east of the sea, to the west of the sea, whales,
Splashed and played. Then,
To the east of the sea, long sisters, six in number, joined hands, forming a ring,
Short sisters, six in number, drove the whales into the ring,
Long brothers, six in number, short brothers, six in number,
Aimed and shot at the whales within the ring, the arrows
Passing beneath, the arrows passing above.
Day after day, they did this,
So I saw in the center of the sea,
A great whale, a whale and its calf, rising and falling,
Splashing and playing.
From afar, with my golden bow, and golden arrows,
I aimed and shot, and with a single arrow,
I pierced both whale and calf at once.
Then, I cut the whale in half,
And threw half into the ring of my sisters. Then, with one and a half whales,
I placed them beneath their tails and headed towards the land of humans,
Arriving at Otasutsu village,
I pushed the one and a half whales
Onto the village beach.
Then, slowly, upon the sea,
I swam back,
When someone,
Breathless, ran beside me,
And I saw it was the sea grebe.
Gasping for breath, it said,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Brave God, Great God,
Why have you given such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, with axes,
With sickles, hack and poke,
And carve away at the great sea bounty, Brave God,
Great God, quickly, take back the great sea bounty!
Though you give them so much sea bounty, the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not appreciate it, and do such things!"
So I laughed and said,
"I have given it to the humans,
Now it is theirs, let the humans
Poke at their possessions with sickles, or
Carve them with axes, let them eat as they please,
What does it matter?" And the sea grebe was discomfited,
But I paid it no mind, and upon the sea,
I swam slowly,
And as the day was ending, I arrived at my sea. And I saw,
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, unable to carry
The half whale, all together, with loud cries,
Were struggling to the east of the sea.
I was truly astonished.
I paid them no mind and returned home,
And sat upon the raised platform.
Then, looking back towards the world of humans,
I saw that around the one and a half
Whales I had cast ashore, splendid men and
Splendid women, in their finest attire,
Rejoiced and danced over the sea bounty, celebrated and leaped, and upon the dunes behind,
A splendid mat was spread,
And upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,
With six robes and a bundled sash, wearing six robes,
And a splendid god's crown, an ancestral crown,
Upon his head, and a god-given sword at his waist,
In a godlike, beautiful manner, raised his hands high,
And offered prayers. The humans wept,
Rejoicing in the sea bounty.
What the grebe said, that the humans
Were poking at the whale I had cast ashore with axes and sickles,
Was not true, for the village chief and
The villagers, from ancient times,
Took out the god sword, which they considered the most precious of treasures,
And with it, they cut the meat and carried it away.
And then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and then, something
Appeared in the window, so
I turned and looked, and upon the window,
A golden cup, overflowing
With sake, and upon it,
Sacred paper streamers attached to sake chopsticks,
Going back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am from Otasutsu village, and
Though it is presumptuous, I offer this sake." And
The village chief of Otasutsu village, representing
All the villagers, spoke in detail of their gratitude,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Great God, Brave God, who else,
When our village was in famine,
And we were so desperately
Lacking food, would have had pity on us?
We are truly grateful that you have given life to our village,
Rejoicing in the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake, and added
Small sacred paper streamers, to offer our thanks
To the Great God." This
The sake chopsticks with streamers declared, going back and forth.
So I rose, and took the golden cup,
And reverently received it,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Poured a little of the fine sake,
And placed the golden cup upon the window.
When that was done, I sat down upon the raised platform,
And saw that the cup, along with the chopsticks,
Had disappeared. Then, carving sheaths,
Engraving sheaths, and soon,
I suddenly raised my face,
And the house was filled with beautiful streamers,
And the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning
Flashed brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then again, two or three days passed,
And at that time, at last, outside the house, my brothers and
Sisters, with loud cries,
Began to drag the whale. I was astonished.
Watching them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters were
Very weary, their faces pale.
When they all entered, seeing the many streamers,
They were amazed, and bowed many times.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of the god's favorite
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful streamers,
Invited the gods of afar, the gods of near,
And held a grand feast. My sisters
Cooked the whale, and when they offered it to the gods,
The gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
As the feast reached its height, I rose,
And told in detail how there was a famine in the human world,
And feeling pity, I had cast ashore the sea bounty,
And how the wicked gods, envying this,
And how the sea grebe had slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu village had expressed his gratitude in such words,
And how the sake chopsticks with streamers had come as envoys,
And as I told the story in detail, the gods
All nodded in unison,
And praised me.
Then again, we held a grand feast,
And the sounds of the gods,
Dancing here and there, leaping,
Made a beautiful sound, and my sisters,
Carrying sake pitchers, went around pouring sake
Between the seats, and sang with beautiful voices
Together with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful streamers each,
And the gods bent low at the waist,
And bowed many times,
And all returned to their homes.
After that, as always, long brothers, six in number,
Long sisters, six in number, short sisters, six in number,
Short brothers, six in number, were with me,
And whenever the humans made sake,
They sent sake to me, and sent streamers to my place.
Now, the humans have no shortage of food
And no troubles, and they live in peace,
So I am at ease.

Atoika Tomatomaki Kuntoteashi Fumu Fumu!
Eldest brothers, six strong, eldest sisters, six fair,
Younger brothers, six bold, younger sisters, six bright,
They nurtured me. But I,
Beside treasures piled high, built a raised platform, and there,
I sat, carving sheaths, engraving sheaths,
That alone,
Seemed my life's purpose.
Each dawn, my brothers,
Quivers shouldered, went forth with my sisters,
And as dusk descended, with weary faces,
Returned empty-handed. My sisters,
Though tired, prepared the meal, set my place with care,
And after we ate and cleared the remnants,
My brothers toiled, crafting arrows anew.
When quivers overflowed, for all were weary,
They slept, loud snores echoing through the night.
The next day, before light touched the sky,
They rose, my sisters preparing the meal, setting my place,
And when all had eaten, they shouldered their quivers once more,
And departed. Again, as evening fell,
With weary faces, they returned empty-handed,
My sisters preparing the meal, my brothers crafting arrows,
Always, they did the same.
One day, as before, my brothers and sisters,
Quivers shouldered, went away.
I carved treasures still, but soon,
I rose from the platform, and with a golden bow,
And golden arrows, stepped into the open,
And saw the sea, vast and serene,
And to the east, to the west, whales,
Splashed and frolicked. Then,
To the east, eldest sisters, six fair, joined hands, forming a ring,
Younger sisters, six bright, drove the whales into the circle,
Eldest brothers, six strong, younger brothers, six bold,
Aimed and shot at the whales within, arrows
Passing beneath, arrows passing above.
Day after day, they did this,
So I saw in the heart of the sea,
A great whale, a whale and its calf, rising and diving,
Splashing and playing.
From afar, with my golden bow, and golden arrows,
I aimed and shot, and with a single arrow,
I pierced both whale and calf as one.
Then, I cleaved the whale in half,
And cast half into my sisters' ring. Then, with one whale and a half,
I placed them beneath their tails and turned towards the human realm,
Arriving at Otasutsu village,
I pushed the one whale and a half
Onto the village shore.
Then, slowly, upon the sea,
I swam back,
When someone,
Breathless, ran beside me,
And I saw it was the sea grebe.
Gasping, it cried,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Brave God, Great God,
Why bestow such bounty upon lowly, wicked humans?
They, with axes,
With sickles, hack and poke,
And desecrate the great gift, Brave God,
Great God, reclaim your bounty!" 
Though you give so freely, the lowly, wicked humans,
Show no gratitude, and do such things!"
So I smiled and said,
"I have gifted it to them,
Now it is theirs. Let them
Poke at their prize with sickles, or
Carve it with axes, let them feast as they wish,
What does it matter?" And the sea grebe seemed troubled,
But I paid it no heed, and upon the sea,
I swam slowly,
And as dusk approached, I reached my sea. And I saw,
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, struggling, unable to carry
The half whale, all together, with strained cries,
Struggling to the east.
I was truly amazed.
I ignored them and returned home,
And sat upon the platform.
Then, looking back towards the human world,
I saw that around the whale and a half
I had cast ashore, splendid men and
Splendid women, in their finest robes,
Rejoiced and danced around the bounty, celebrated and leaped, and upon the dunes,
A splendid mat was laid,
And upon it, the village elder of Otasutsu village,
With six robes and a bundled sash, wearing six layers,
And a splendid god's crown, an ancestral crown,
Upon his head, and a god-given sword at his waist,
In a godlike, beautiful manner, raised his hands high,
And offered prayers. The humans wept,
Rejoicing in the gift.
The grebe lied, saying they
Were hacking at the whale with axes and sickles,
For the elder and
The villagers, from ancient times,
Had taken out the god-sword, their most precious treasure,
And with it, they carved the meat and carried it away.
And still, my brothers and sisters did not return.
Two or three days passed, and then, something
Appeared at the window, so
I turned and saw, upon the window,
A golden cup, overflowing
With sake, and upon it,
Sacred paper streamers tied to sake chopsticks,
Moving back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"We are from Otasutsu village, and
Though we are unworthy, we offer this sake." And
The village elder of Otasutsu village, representing
All the villagers, spoke in detail of their gratitude,
"Tominkarukur Kamuykarukur Isoyankekur
Great God, Brave God, who else,
When famine gripped our village,
And we were desperately
Starving, would have shown us such mercy?
We are eternally grateful that you have given life to our village,
Rejoicing in the bounty,
We have made a little sake, and added
Small sacred streamers, to offer our thanks
To the Great God." This
The sake chopsticks with streamers declared, moving back and forth.
So I rose, and took the golden cup,
And reverently accepted it,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Poured a little of the finest sake,
And placed the golden cup upon the window.
When that was done, I sat down upon the platform,
And saw that the cup, along with the chopsticks,
Had vanished. Then, carving sheaths,
Engraving sheaths, and soon,
I suddenly looked up,
And the house was filled with beautiful streamers,
And the house was filled with white clouds, and white lightning
Flashed brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then again, two or three days passed,
And at last, outside the house, my brothers and
Sisters, with strained cries,
Began to drag the whale. I was astonished.
Watching them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters were
Exhausted, their faces pale.
When they all entered, seeing the many streamers,
They were amazed, and bowed repeatedly.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of the god's favorite
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful streamers,
Invited the gods of afar, the gods of near,
And held a grand feast. My sisters
Cooked the whale, and when they offered it to the gods,
The gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
As the feast reached its peak, I rose,
And told in detail how famine had struck the human world,
And feeling pity, I had cast ashore the bounty,
And how the wicked gods, envying this,
And how the sea grebe had slandered me,
And how the village elder of Otasutsu village had expressed his gratitude,
And how the sake chopsticks with streamers had come as envoys,
And as I told the story, the gods
All nodded in unison,
And praised me.
Then again, we held a grand feast,
And the sounds of the gods,
Dancing here and there, leaping,
Made a beautiful sound, and my sisters,
Carrying sake pitchers, went around pouring sake
Between the seats, and sang with beautiful voices
Together with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful streamers each,
And the gods bent low at the waist,
And bowed repeatedly,
And all returned to their homes.
After that, as always, eldest brothers, six strong,
Eldest sisters, six fair, younger sisters, six bright,
Younger brothers, six bold, were with me,
And whenever the humans made sake,
They sent sake to me, and sent streamers to my place.
Now, the humans lack nothing,
And live in peace,
So I am content.

The initial translation is generally accurate but can be improved in terms of flow, naturalness, and capturing the nuances of the original Japanese. Some phrases are a bit clunky or overly literal. The repetition in the original is not always effectively conveyed. The honorifics and implied cultural context could be subtly enhanced to give a better sense of the speaker's tone and the story's setting. The translation could also benefit from a slightly more poetic touch, given the chant-like nature of the original text.
