小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「クツニサ クトンクトン」

クツニサ クトンクトン
ある日に水源の方へ遊びに
出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が
胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに
腰を曲げ曲げしている.
私を見ると,いう事には,
「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」
という.見ると,胡桃の簗
なものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水
が流れて来て鮭どもが
上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので
泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので
小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を
引ったくり小男の腰の央を
私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の
腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい
地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を
揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の
彼方まで届いている様だ.
それから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を
出して,その杭を根本から
折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.
水源から清い風,清い水が
流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.
鮭どもは清い風,清い水に
気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び
ながら,パチャパチャと
上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし
流れに沿うて帰って来た.と
小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

This is the English translation.
This is the song of Okikirmui, sung by himself:
"Kutsunisa Kutonkuton"

Kutsunisa Kutonkuton

One day, I went to play near the source of the river. There, I saw a little man, hunched over, hammering stakes to build a weir of walnut wood.

He saw me and said, "Who are you? Nephew, please help me!"

I looked closer. It was a walnut weir, and the water flowing through it was murky with walnut. The salmon, trying to swim upstream, hated the walnut water and turned back, weeping.

I was furious. I snatched the hammer from the little man and struck him hard in the small of his back. *Pon!* The sound echoed. I broke his back, killed him, and kicked him down to hell.

I shook his walnut stake, and it seemed to reach all the way to the sixth level of hell.

Then, gathering all the strength in my back, all the power in my body, I broke the stake at its base and kicked it down to hell as well.

Clear wind and clear water began to flow from the source. The salmon, who had been weeping, were revived by the clear wind and water. They rejoiced, laughing and splashing as they swam upstream.

Seeing this, I was relieved and followed the flow of the river back home.

And that is the story told by little Okikirmui.

This is the song Okikirmui sang himself:
"Kutsunisa Kutonkuton"

Kutsunisa Kutonkuton

One day, I went to play near the water source. There, I saw a little man, bending and straining, driving stakes to build a weir made of walnut wood.

He saw me and said, "Who's there? Hey, nephew, give me a hand here!"

I looked closer. Because it was a walnut weir, walnut water, murky water, flowed through it. The salmon tried to swim upstream, but they hated the walnut water and went back, weeping. This made me furious.

I snatched the hammer the little man was holding and struck him right in the small of his back. *Pon!* The sound echoed. I broke the little man's back, killed him, and kicked him down to hell.

I shook his walnut stake, and it seemed to reach all the way to the sixth hell.

Then, gathering all the strength in my back, all the power in my body, I broke that stake from its base and kicked it down to hell as well.

Clear wind and clear water began to flow from the water source. The salmon, who had been weeping, regained their spirit with the clear wind and water. They rejoiced, laughing and splashing as they swam upstream.

Seeing this, I was relieved and followed the flow of the river back home. So, that is the story told by little Okikirmui.

The initial translation is generally good, but it can be improved by:

*   More closely reflecting the original Japanese sentence structure and flow, especially in the more descriptive parts.
*   Adding a bit more vividness to the language to capture the tone of a sung chant/story.
*   Clarifying some potentially ambiguous phrases.
*   Maintaining consistency in word choices (e.g., "small of his back" vs. "back").
*   Improving the flow and readability of certain sentences.
*   Adding some cultural context if possible.
