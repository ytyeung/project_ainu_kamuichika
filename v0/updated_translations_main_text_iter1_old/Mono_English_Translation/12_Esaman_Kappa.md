獺かわうそが自ら歌った謡
「カッパ レウレウ カッパ」

カッパ レウレウ カッパ
ある日に,流れに沿うて遊びながら
泳いで下りサマユンクルの
水汲路のところに来ると,
サマユンクルの妹が神の様な美しい容子で
片手に手桶を持ち片手に
蒲の束を持って来ているので
川の縁に私は頭だけ出し,
「お父様をお持ちですか?
お母様をお持ちですか?」と云うと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見つけると,怒の色を顔に
現して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと,大きな犬どもが
駈け出して来て,私を見ると牙を鳴ら
している.私はビックリして川の底へ
潜り込んで直ぐそのまま川底を通って
逃げ下った.
そうして,オキキリムイの水汲路の
川口へ頭だけだして
見ると,オキキリムイの妹が
神の様に美しい様子で片手に手桶を持ち
片手に蒲の束を持って
来たので私のいうことには,
「御父様をお持ちですか?
御母様をお持ちですか?」というと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見ると,怒りの色を顔に
表して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと大きな犬どもが駈け出して来た.
それを見て私は先刻の事を思い出し
可笑しく思いながら川の底へ
潜りこんで逃げようとしたら,
まさか犬たちがそんな事をしようとは
思わなかったのに,牙を鳴らしながら
川の底まで私に飛び付き
陸へ私を引き摺り上げ,私の頭も私の体も
噛みつかれ噛みむしられて,しまいに
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気が付いて見ると,
大きな獺の耳と耳の間に私はすわって
いた.
サマユンクルもオキキリムイも
父もなく母もないのを私は知って
あんな悪戯をしたので罰を当てられ
オキキリムイの犬どもに殺され
つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
これからの獺たちよ,決して悪戯をしなさるな.
と,獺が物語った.

**The Otter's Own Lament**
*"Kappa Reu Reu Kappa"*

Kappa Reu Reu Kappa,

One day, as I frolicked along the stream, swimming downstream, I came to the water-drawing place of Samayunkuru. There, Samayunkuru's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I poked my head out of the water's edge and asked, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, startled, looked around with wide eyes. When she spotted me, anger flashed across her face.

"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead, making fun of people! Dogs, here!..." she cried.

At once, large dogs came rushing out, baring their fangs at me. Terrified, I dove to the bottom of the river and fled downstream.

Then, I peeked my head out at the river mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing place. There, Okikirmui's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I asked her, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, startled, looked around with wide eyes. When she spotted me, anger flashed across her face.

"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead, making fun of people! Dogs, here!..." she cried.

Large dogs came rushing out. Remembering what had happened before, I chuckled to myself and tried to dive to the bottom of the river to escape.

But, to my surprise, the dogs leaped into the water, fangs bared, and attacked me! They dragged me ashore, biting and tearing at my head and body until I lost consciousness.

When I finally came to, I found myself sitting between the ears of a large otter.

I knew that neither Samayunkuru nor Okikirmui had fathers or mothers. I was punished for playing such a prank. I was killed by Okikirmui's dogs, meeting a foolish, wretched end.

So, listen well, all you otters to come: never play such pranks!

Thus, the otter lamented.

Kappa Reu Reu Kappa,

One day, as I played along the stream, swimming downstream, I came to the water-drawing place of Samayunkuru. There, Samayunkuru's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I poked my head out at the water's edge and asked, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, startled, looked around with wide eyes. When she spotted me, anger flashed across her face.

"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead, making a fool of people! Dogs, here!..." she cried.

At once, large dogs came rushing out, baring their fangs at me. Terrified, I dove to the bottom of the river and fled downstream.

Then, I peeked my head out at the river mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing place. There, Okikirmui's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

The original translation is good, but it can be improved by making the language slightly more archaic to reflect the fact that this is a chant or lament. Some phrases can be made more vivid and closer to the original Japanese. For example, 'frolicked along the stream' can be more literally translated as 'playing along the stream'. Also, 'making fun of people' can be more accurately translated as 'making a fool of people'. The phrase 'meeting a foolish, wretched end' can be improved to 'meeting a pointless, wretched death'.
