蛙が自らを歌った謡
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」

トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!
「ある日に,草原を飛び廻って
遊んでいるうちに見ると,
一軒の家があるので戸口へ行って
見ると,家の内に宝の積んである側に
高床がある.その高床の上に
一人の若者が鞘を刻んでうつむいて
いたので,私は悪戯をしかけようと思って敷居の上に
坐って,「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴いた,ところが,彼の若者は刀持つ手を上げ
私を見ると,ニッコリ笑って,
「それはお前の謡かえ? お前の喜びの歌かえ?
もっと聞きたいね.」というので
私はよろこんで「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴くと,彼の若者のいう事には,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」
私はそれをきいて嬉しく思い下座の方の
炉縁の上へピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴くと
彼の若者のいうことには,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」それを聞くと私は,
本当に嬉しくなって,上座の方の炉縁の
隅のところへピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴いたら
突然!彼の若者がパッと起ち
上ったかと思うと,大きな薪の燃えさしを
取り上げて私の上へ投げつけた音は
体の前がふさがったように思われて,それっきり
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たら
芥捨あくすて場の末に,一つの腹のふくれた蛙が
死んでいて,その耳と耳との間に私はすわっていた.
よく見ると,ただの人間の家
だと思ったのは,オキキリムイ,神の様に
強い方の家なのであった,そして
オキキリムイだという事も知らずに
私が悪戯をしたのであった.
私はもう今この様につまらない死方,悪い死方
をするのだから,これからの
蛙たちよ,決して,人間たちに悪戯をするのではないよ.
と,ふくれた蛙が云いながら死んでしまった.

This is the English translation.
This is the song of a frog, telling his own tale:

"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

"One day, as I hopped and played through the meadow, I spied a house. I went to the doorway and peered inside. There, amidst a pile of treasures, was a raised platform. Upon that platform sat a young man, carving a sheath, his head bowed low.

Thinking to play a trick, I sat upon the threshold and sang out, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

The young man raised his hand, the one holding the knife, and looked at me. He smiled gently and said, "Is that your song? Your song of joy? I would like to hear more."

Pleased, I sang again, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

The young man then asked, "Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau? I would like to hear it closer."

Hearing this, I was delighted! I hopped down to the lower hearth and sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

Again, the young man said, "Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau? I would like to hear it closer."

My heart swelled with joy! I hopped to the corner of the upper hearth and sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

Suddenly! The young man leaped to his feet! He grabbed a burning log and threw it at me! I felt as though the world had closed in around me, and then... I knew no more.

When I awoke, I was at the edge of the garbage heap. A bloated frog lay dead, and I was perched between its ears.

Looking closer, I realized that what I had thought was a simple human house was, in fact, the home of Okikirmui, a god of immense power! And I, without knowing, had played a trick on him.

Now, I die this foolish, this wretched death. So, I say to all frogs who come after me: Never, ever play tricks on humans!

And with those words, the bloated frog breathed his last."

### Output
```
This is the song of a frog, recounting his own lament:

"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

"One bright day, as I frolicked and leaped through the tall grasses of the meadow, my eyes fell upon a dwelling. Curious, I approached the entrance and peeked inside. There, surrounded by a glittering hoard of treasures, stood a raised platform. Upon this platform sat a young man, diligently carving a sheath, his head bent in concentration.

Seized by a mischievous impulse, I perched upon the threshold and chirped out, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

The young man paused, raising the hand that held the carving knife. He turned his gaze upon me, a gentle smile gracing his lips. "Is that your song? A joyful song that springs from your heart? I would gladly hear more."

Elated by his words, I sang out once more, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

The young man then inquired, "Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau? I wish to hear it from a closer distance."

Hearing this invitation, my heart leaped with joy! I hopped down to the lower edge of the hearth and proclaimed, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

Again, the young man beckoned, "Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau? I long to hear it closer still."

Overwhelmed with delight, I gathered my courage and hopped to the corner of the upper hearth, right beside him, and sang with all my might, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

Suddenly! In a flash, the young man sprang to his feet! He seized a burning ember from the fire and hurled it directly at me! A searing heat engulfed me, the world turned black, and then... oblivion.

When consciousness returned, I found myself at the very edge of the refuse heap. A bloated frog lay lifeless, and there I was, perched between its lifeless ears.

Looking more closely, the truth dawned upon me: what I had mistaken for a simple human dwelling was, in reality, the sacred home of Okikirmui, a god of immeasurable power! And I, in my ignorance, had dared to play a trick upon him.

Now, I meet this ignominious end, a wretched and foolish death. Therefore, I implore all frogs who follow in my wake: Never, ever trifle with humans, for they may be gods in disguise!

And with these final words of warning, the bloated frog breathed his last, his tale forever etched in the annals of amphibian folly."
