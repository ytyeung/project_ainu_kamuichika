谷地の魔神が自ら歌った謡「ハリツ クンナ」

ハリツ クンナ
ある日に好いお天気なので
私の谷地に眼と口とだけ
出して見ていたところが
ずっと浜の方から人の話し声がきこえて来た.
見ると,二人の若者が連れだって来た.
先に来た者は勇者らしく勇者の品を
そなえて,神の様に美しいが
後から来た者を見ると,様子の悪い
顔色の悪い男で,何か話し合いながら
やって来たが私の谷地の側を通り
ちょうど私の前へ来ると,あとから来た顔色の悪い男が
立ち止り立ち止り自分の鼻をおおい
「おお臭い,いやな谷地,悪い谷地の前を通ったら
まあ汚い,何だろうこんなに臭いのは.」
と言った.
私はただ聞いたばかりだけれど自分の居るか居ないかも
わからぬほど腹が立った.
泥の中から飛び出した.私が飛び上ると
地が裂け地が破れる.牙を
鳴らしながら,彼等を強く追っかけたところが
先に来た者は,それと見るや
魚がクルリとあとへかえる様に引っかえして顔色の悪い男の
わきの下をくぐりずーっと逃げてしまった.
青い男を二間三間追っかけると
直ぐ追いついて頭から呑んでしまった.
そこで今度は彼かの男をありったけの速力で追っかけて来て
人間の村,大きな村の後へ着いた.
見るとむこうから
火の老女,神の老女があかい着物,六枚の着物に
帯をしめ,六枚の着物を羽織って
あかい杖をついて私の側へ飛んで来た.
「これはこれは,お前は何しにこのアイヌ村へ
来るのか,さあお帰り,さあお帰り.」
言いながら,あかい杖,かねの杖をふり上げて私を
たたくと,杖から焔が
私の上へ雨の様に降って来る.
けれども私はちっとも構わず,
牙打ち鳴らしながら彼の男を
追っかけると,彼の男は村の中を
よくまわる環の様に走って行く.そのあとを飛んで
行くと,大地が裂け大地が破れる.村中は大さわぎ
妻の手を引く者,子の手を引く者,泣き叫び
逃げゆくもの,煮えくりかえるようなありさま,けれども
私は少しも構わず,土吹雪
をたてる,火の老女神は私の側を走って来ると
大へんな焔が,私の上に飛び交う.
その中に,彼の男は一軒の家に
飛び込むと直ぐにまた飛び出した.
見ると,蓬の小弓に蓬の小矢をつがえて
むこうから,ニコニコして,私をねらっている.
それを見て私は可笑しく思った.
「あんな小さな蓬の矢,何で人が苦しむものか.」と
思いながら私は牙を打ち鳴らして,
頭から呑もうとしたら
その時彼の男は私の首ッ玉を
したたかに射た.それっきりどうしたか
わからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たところが
大きな竜の耳と耳の間に私はいた.
村の人々が集って,彼かの私が追っかけた若者が
大声で指図さしずをして,私の屍体をみんな細かに刻み
一つ所へ運んで焼いてその灰を
山の岩の岩の後へ捨ててしまった.
今になってはじめて見ると,それは,ただの人間
ただの若者だと思ったのは
オキキリムイ,神の勇者であった.
恐しい悪い神,悪魔神,私はそれであって
人間の村の近くにいるので,
オキキリムイは村の為を思って,私をおこらせ
自分を追いかけさせて,蓬の矢で私を殺したので
あった.それから,先に私が呑んでしまった
青い男は,人間だと思ったのだったが
それは,オキキリムイがその放糞を人に作り,
それを連れて来たのであった.
私は魔神であったから今はもう
地獄のおそろしい悪い国にやられたのだから
これからは,人間の国には,なんの危険も
ない,邪魔ものもないであろう.
私は恐しい魔神であったけれども,
一人の人間の計略にまけて
今はもう,つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
と谷地の魔神が物語りました.

The Mire Demon's Own Sung Ballad: "Haritsu Kunna"

Haritsu Kunna, hear my tale,
On a day of sunlit vale.
From my mire, just eyes and mouth,
I watched the world, from north to south.

Voices came upon the breeze,
From the shore, beneath the trees.
Two young men, I saw them stride,
Toward my mire, side by side.

The first, a hero, strong and bright,
A godlike beauty, filled with light.
The second, sickly, pale of face,
A wretched air, a foul disgrace.

They spoke in whispers, drawing near,
Until my mire was crystal clear.
The sickly one, he stopped and cried,
His nose he pinched, his face he hide.

"Oh, the stench! This mire is cursed!
A foulness here, the very worst!"
I heard his words, a burning sting,
My rage arose, on furious wing.

From the mud, I burst and flew,
The earth it cracked, the ground it knew.
With gnashing teeth, I gave them chase,
To banish them from this sacred place.

The hero saw, and turned with speed,
Like fish that twist, to plant a seed.
Beneath the wretch's arm he flew,
And fled away, from me and you.

The sickly man, I chased him down,
Two steps, three steps, then wore the crown.
I caught him quick, and swallowed whole,
His wretched life, I took his soul.

Then turned my wrath, with all my might,
To chase the hero, out of sight.
He fled toward a village grand,
A human place, in this fair land.

Then from the village, drawing near,
A fiery crone, dispelled all fear.
In robes of red, six layers deep,
A staff of fire, secrets to keep.

"What brings you here, to Ainu land?
Begone, foul beast, I command!"
She raised her staff, a fiery brand,
And struck at me, with burning hand.

Flames like rain, upon me fell,
But still I chased, with savage yell.
He ran in circles, round and round,
While earth did crack, with awful sound.

The village screamed, in wild dismay,
As parents fled, and children stray.
A boiling chaos, fear took hold,
But still I chased, so brave and bold.

The fiery crone, she ran beside,
With flames that danced, a burning tide.
The hero dove, into a home,
Then out again, no longer prone.

A bow of wormwood, in his hand,
An arrow notched, at my command.
He smiled at me, with steady gaze,
And aimed his shot, in cunning ways.

I laughed aloud, "A puny dart!
How can such weakness pierce my heart?"
I gnashed my teeth, prepared to feast,
To swallow him, both man and beast.

But then he struck, with deadly aim,
The arrow pierced, my vital frame.
I knew no more, my senses fled,
And darkness fell, upon my head.

I woke to find, a gruesome sight,
Between the ears, of dragon might.
The villagers, they gathered near,
The hero spoke, for all to hear.

He ordered them, with voice so strong,
To cut my corpse, where I was wrong.
They chopped me small, with blade and stone,
And burned my flesh, to leave me prone.

My ashes cast, behind the stone,
My reign of terror, overthrown.
I see it now, with fading breath,
He was no man, but faced with death.

Okikirmui, the hero bright,
Who saved his village, from my blight.
He angered me, and made me chase,
Then killed me swift, in this vile place.

The sickly man, I swallowed whole,
Was not a man, but took its toll.
Okikirmui, with cunning art,
Had made a thing, to play its part.

A demon I, now doomed to dwell,
In hellish realms, where shadows fell.
No more I'll haunt, the human land,
No more I'll threaten, with my hand.

A fearsome demon, I have been,
But tricked by man, a mortal sin.
A wretched death, a shameful end,
This is the tale, the mire did send.

The Mire Demon's Own Sung Ballad: "Haritsu Kunna"

Haritsu Kunna,
One day, because the weather was fine,
I was looking out from my mire,
With only my eyes and mouth showing,
When I heard voices of people coming from the shore.
Looking, I saw two young men coming together.
The one who came first seemed like a hero,
Possessing the qualities of a hero,
Beautiful like a god,
But when I looked at the one who came after,
He was a man with a bad complexion,
A man with an unhealthy face. They were talking about something
as they came,
And as they passed by my mire,
Just as they came in front of me, the man with the unhealthy face
Stopped, stopped and covered his nose,
"Oh, how smelly! A disgusting mire! Passing by a bad mire,
How filthy! What is this that smells so much?"
He said.
I only heard it, but I became so angry that
I didn't even know if I was there or not.
I jumped out from the mud. When I jumped up,
The ground split and the ground broke.
While gnashing my teeth, I chased after them fiercely,
But the one who came first, as soon as he saw that,
Like a fish turning back,
He turned around and slipped under the arm of the man with the unhealthy face,
And ran away.
Chasing after the blue man for two or three steps,
I quickly caught up and swallowed him whole, head first.
Then, with all my speed, I chased after
the other man,
And arrived behind a human village, a large village.
Looking, from the other side
A fire old woman, a divine old woman, in red clothes,
six layers of clothes,
With a belt tied, wearing six layers of clothes,
With a red staff, flew to my side.
"Well, well, what have you come to do in this Ainu village?
Now go home, now go home."
While saying this, she raised her red staff, a metal staff,
And when she struck me,
Flames rained down from the staff
Upon me.
But I didn't care at all,
While gnashing my teeth, chasing after the man,
The man ran through the village
Like a well-worn ring. Flying after him,
The earth split and the earth broke. The whole village was in an uproar,
Some pulling the hands of their wives, some pulling the hands of their children, crying and
Fleeing, a boiling chaos, but
I didn't care at all, raising dust storms.
The fire old goddess ran to my side,
And tremendous flames flew over me.
In the midst of that, the man
Jumped into a house and immediately jumped out again.
Looking, with a small bow of wormwood and a small arrow of wormwood notched,
From the other side, smiling, he was aiming at me.
Seeing that, I thought it was funny.
"How can people suffer from such a small wormwood arrow?"
Thinking that, I gnashed my teeth,
And tried to swallow him head first,
But then the man shot my neck
Hard. After that, I didn't know what happened.
When I suddenly came to, I was
Between the ears of a large dragon.
The villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased
Was loudly giving instructions, and everyone finely chopped up my corpse
And carried it to one place and burned it, and threw the ashes
Behind a rock on the mountain.
Now that I see it for the first time, what I thought was just a human,
Just a young man,
Was Okikirmui, the divine hero.
A terrifying, bad god, a demon god, that's what I was,
And because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui, thinking of the village, angered me
Made me chase him, and killed me with a wormwood arrow.
And then, the blue man I swallowed earlier,
I thought he was a human, but it took its toll.
Okikirmui, with cunning art,
Had made a thing from his excrement,
And brought it with him.
Because I was a demon god, now I have been
Sent to the terrifying, bad country of hell,
From now on, there will be no danger
And no obstacles in the human country.
I was a terrifying demon god,
But defeated by the scheme of a single human,
Now I am dying a meaningless death, a bad death.
So the mire demon told his story.

The initial translation captures the general narrative flow and tone of the original Japanese text. However, it takes significant liberties with the phrasing and structure, resulting in a loss of some of the original's nuances and directness. The rhyming scheme, while adding a poetic quality, sometimes forces unnatural word choices that obscure the meaning. The translation also occasionally embellishes the original text, adding details not explicitly present. For example, the line "To banish them from this sacred place" is not directly supported by the Japanese text. The translation could be improved by adhering more closely to the original's sentence structure and word choices, while still maintaining a natural and engaging English style. The rhyming scheme could be relaxed to allow for greater accuracy and clarity.
