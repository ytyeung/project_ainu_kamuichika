沼貝が自ら歌った謡「トヌペカ ランラン」

トヌペカ ランラン
強烈な日光に私の居る所も
乾いてしまって今にも私は死にそうです.
「誰か,水を飲ませて下すって
助けて下さればいい.水よ水よ」と私たちが泣き叫んで
いますと,ずーっと浜の方から一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.
私たちは泣いていますと,私たちの傍を通り
私たちを見ると,
「おかしな沼貝,悪い沼貝,何を泣いて
うるさい事さわいでいるのだろう.」と言って
私たちを踏みつけ,足先にかけ飛ばし,貝殻と共につぶして
ずーっと山へ行ってしまいました.
「おお痛,苦しい,水よ水よ.」と泣き叫んで
いると,ずっと浜の方からまた一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.私たちは
「誰か私たちに水を飲ませて助けて下さるといい,
おお痛,おお苦しい,水よ水よ.」と叫び泣きました
すると,娘さんは,神の様な美しい気高い様子で
私の側へ来て私たちを見ると,
「まあかわいそうに,大へん暑くて沼貝たちの
寝床も乾いてしまって水を欲しがって
いるのだね,どうしたのでしょう
何だか踏みつけられでもした様だが......」と言いつつ
私たちみんなを拾い集めて蕗の葉に
入れて,きれいな湖に入れてくれました.
清い冷水でスッカリ元気を恢復し
大へん丈夫になりました.そこで始めて
かの女たちの気性を探って
見ると,先に来て,私を踏みつぶした
にくらしい女,わるい女はサマユンクルの
妹で,私たちを憫み
助けて下さった若い娘さん淑しとやかな方
は,オキキリムイの妹なのでありました.
サマユンクルの妹は悪にくらしいので
その粟畑を枯らしてしまい,オキキリムイの
妹のその粟畑をばよく実らせました.
その年に,オキキリムイの妹は大そう多く収穫をしました.
私の故為せいでそうなった事を知って
沼貝の殻で粟の穂を摘みました.
それから,毎年,人間の女たちは
栗の穂を摘む時は沼貝の殻を使う様になったのです.
と,一つの沼貝が物語りました.

This is the English translation.
This is the song of the marsh clam, "Tonupeka Ranran," sung by myself.

Tonupeka Ranran...

The fierce sun beats down, and the place where I dwell is dried up. I feel as though I am about to die.

"Oh, someone, please give us water to drink! Please help us! Water, water!" we cried out.

Then, from the direction of the beach, a woman came carrying a basket on her back. As we cried, she passed by us. When she saw us, she said, "You strange marsh clams, you wretched marsh clams! What are you crying about, making such a racket?"

And with that, she trampled upon us, kicked us away with her toes, crushing us with our shells. Then, she went off towards the mountains.

"Oh, it hurts! It's painful! Water, water!" we cried out.

Then, from the direction of the beach, another woman came carrying a basket on her back. We cried out, "Oh, someone, please give us water to drink and help us! Oh, it hurts! Oh, it's painful! Water, water!"

Then, the young woman, with a divine and beautiful air of nobility, came to my side. When she saw us, she said, "Oh, you poor things! It's so hot, and the marsh clams' beds have dried up. They must be longing for water. What happened? It looks like you've been trampled..."

And with that, she gathered us all up, placed us on a butterbur leaf, and put us in a beautiful lake.

In the pure, cold water, we completely regained our strength and became very healthy. It was then that I began to investigate the nature of these women.

The hateful woman who came first and trampled upon me was the younger sister of Samayunkuru. The kind young woman who pitied us and helped us was the younger sister of Okikirmui.

Because the younger sister of Samayunkuru was wicked and hateful, she caused her millet field to wither. But the younger sister of Okikirmui caused her millet field to bear much fruit.

That year, the younger sister of Okikirmui had a great harvest. Knowing that this was because of me, she used marsh clam shells to harvest the millet ears.

And from then on, every year, when human women harvest millet ears, they use marsh clam shells.

So spoke one of the marsh clams.

This is the song of the marsh clam, "Tonupeka Ranran," sung by myself. 

Tonupeka Ranran...

The fierce sun blazes, and my home is parched. I feel as though I'm about to die.

"Someone, please, water! Help us! Water!" we cried, desperate for relief.

Then, from the beach, a woman appeared, a basket strapped to her back. Ignoring our cries, she passed us by. Seeing us, she sneered, "You pathetic marsh clams! What's all this racket about?"

And with that, she trampled us underfoot, kicking us aside, crushing our shells. Then, she vanished towards the mountains.

"Oh, the pain! Water!" we cried, our voices cracking.

Then, from the beach, another woman approached, also carrying a basket. We pleaded, "Someone, please, give us water and help us! Oh, the pain! Water!"

Then, a young woman, radiant with a divine and gentle grace, came to our side. Seeing our plight, she murmured, "Oh, you poor things! It's so hot, and your beds have dried up. You must be so thirsty. What happened here? It looks like you've been trampled..."

And with that, she carefully gathered us up, placed us on a butterbur leaf, and gently laid us in a beautiful, clear lake.

In the pure, cold water, we were completely revived and became strong once more. It was then that I learned the true nature of these women.

The cruel woman who came first and trampled us was the younger sister of Samayunkuru. The kind young woman who pitied us and saved us was the younger sister of Okikirmui.

Because the younger sister of Samayunkuru was wicked and heartless, she caused her millet field to wither and die. But the younger sister of Okikirmui blessed her millet field, and it flourished.

That year, the younger sister of Okikirmui reaped a bountiful harvest. Knowing that she owed her success to us, she used marsh clam shells to harvest the millet.

And from that day forward, every year, when women harvest millet, they use marsh clam shells.

So spoke one of the marsh clams.

The initial translation is generally accurate but can be improved for flow and nuance. Some phrases are a bit clunky and can be made more natural. The repetition of "water, water!" could be handled more effectively to convey the desperation. The descriptions of the women could be more vivid and less literal. The ending feels a bit abrupt and could be smoothed out.
