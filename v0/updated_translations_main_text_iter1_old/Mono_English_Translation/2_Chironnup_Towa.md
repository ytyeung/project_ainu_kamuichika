狐が自ら歌った謡「トワトワト」

トワトワト
ある日に海辺へ食物を拾いに
出かけました.
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行きながら自分の行手を見たところが
海辺に鯨が寄り上って
人間たちがみんな盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば喜び躍り肉を切る者運ぶ者が
行き交かって重立った人たちは海幸をば謝し拝む者
刀をとぐ者など浜一ぱいに黒く見えます.
私はそれを見ると大層喜びました.
「ああ早くあそこへ着いて
少しでもいいから貰いたいものだ」と
思って「ばんざーい! ばんざーい」と
叫びながら
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行って行って近くへ行って見ましたら
ちっとも思いがけなかったのに
鯨が上ったのだとばかり思ったのは
浜辺に犬どもの便所があって
大きな糞の山があります,
それを鯨だと私は思ったので
ありました.
人間たちが海幸をば喜んで躍り海幸をば喜び舞い
肉を切ったりはこんだりしているのだと
私が思ったのはからすどもが
糞をつっつき糞を散らし散らし
その方へ飛びこの方へ飛びしているのでした.
私は腹が立ちました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
海のそばから走りながら
見たところが私の行手に
舟があってその舟の中で
人間が二人互いにお悔みをのべています,
「おや,何の急変が
あるのでああいう事をしているのだろう,もしや
舟と一しょに引繰ひっくりかえった人でもあるのではないかしら,
おお早くずっと近くへ行って
人の話を聞きたいものだ.」
と思うのでフオホホーイと
高く叫んで
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして行って見たら
舟だと思ったのは浜辺にある
岩であって,人だと思ったのは
二羽の大きな鵜であったのでした.
二羽の大きな鵜が長い首をのばしたり縮めたり
しているのを悔みを言い合っている様に
私は見たのでありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして川をのぼって行きましたところが
ずーっと川上に女が二人
浅瀬に立っていて泣き合っています.
私はそれを見てビックリして
「おや,なんの悪い事があって
なんの凶報が来てあんなに泣き合って
いるのだろう?
ああ早く着いて人の話を
聞きたいものだ.」
と思って
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして行って見たら
川の中程に二つの簗やながあって
二つの簗の杭くいが流れにあたってグラグラ動いているのを
二人の女がうつむいたり仰むいたりして
泣き合っているのだと私は思ったの
でありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた,川をのぼって
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして帰って来ました.
自分の行手を見ましたところが
どうしたのだか
私の家が燃えあがって
大空へ立ちのぼる煙は
立ちこめた雲の様です.それを見た私は
ビックリして気を失うほど
驚きました.女の声で叫びながら
飛び上りますと,むこうから誰かが
大きな声でホーイと叫びながら私のそばへ
飛んで来ました.見るとそれは私の妻で
ビックリした顔色で息せききって,
「旦那様どうしたのですか?」
と云うので,見ると
火事の様に見えたのに
私の家はもとのまま
たっています.火もなし,煙もありません.
それは,私の妻が搗物つきものをしていると
その時に風が強く吹いて簸ている粟の
糠ぬかが吹き飛ばされるさまを
煙の様に私は見たのでありました.
食物を探しに出かけても食物も見付からず,その上に
また,私が大声を上げたので私の妻が
それに驚いて簸ていた粟をも
簸と一しょに放り飛ばしてしまったので
今夜は食べる事も出来ません
私は腹立たしくて床の底へ
身を投げて寝てしまいました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
  と
狐の頭かしらが物語りました.

The Fox's Tale: Towa Towa To

Towa towa to...

One day, I set out for the shore, hoping to find a bite to eat.

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

As I went, I looked ahead and saw a sight! A whale had beached itself on the shore! People were dressed in their finest clothes, celebrating the bounty of the sea. They danced and rejoiced, some cutting the meat, others carrying it away. Important-looking folk offered thanks and prayers to the sea, while others sharpened their knives. The beach was black with people!

Seeing this, I was overjoyed. "Oh, if only I could get there quickly and receive even a small piece!" I thought, and cried out, "Banzai! Banzai!"

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

I hurried closer, but what I found was not at all what I expected. What I thought was a beached whale was nothing more than a pile of dog droppings on the sand!

And the people celebrating the sea's bounty, dancing and carrying meat? They were just crows, pecking at the dung, scattering it this way and that, flying here and there.

I was furious!

"Blind, foolish creature!
Blind, wicked creature!
Stinky thing beneath the tail!
Rotten thing beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Dirty water dripping from your backside!
What a way to see the world!"

Then again,

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

I ran along the shore and saw a boat in the distance. Two people inside seemed to be exchanging condolences.

"Oh my," I wondered, "what sudden tragedy has befallen them? Perhaps someone has capsized with the boat! I must hurry closer and hear what they have to say!" So I cried out, "Foo-hoo-hoy!"

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

I flew as fast as I could, only to discover that what I thought was a boat was just a rock on the beach, and the people were nothing more than two large cormorants.

The two large cormorants were stretching and retracting their long necks, and I mistook it for them exchanging condolences.

"Blind, foolish creature!
Blind, wicked creature!
Stinky thing beneath the tail!
Rotten thing beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Dirty water dripping from your backside!
What a way to see the world!"

And again,

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

I flew up the river, and far upstream, I saw two women standing in the shallows, weeping together.

I was startled. "Oh dear, what misfortune has befallen them? What ill tidings have arrived that they weep so? I must hurry and hear their story!"

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

I flew as fast as I could, only to find two fish weirs in the middle of the river. The posts of the weirs were shaking in the current, and I had mistaken them for two women, heads bowed and raised, weeping together.

"Blind, foolish creature!
Blind, wicked creature!
Stinky thing beneath the tail!
Rotten thing beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Dirty water dripping from your backside!
What a way to see the world!"

And then, I flew back down the river,

*Chara chara* through the stones,
*Chara chara* through the driftwood,

I flew home. But what was this?

My house was ablaze! Smoke billowed into the sky like a gathering storm cloud. I was so shocked that I nearly fainted. I cried out in a woman's voice and leaped into the air, when someone came flying towards me, shouting "Hoo-ey!" It was my wife, her face pale with fright, breathless.

"Husband, what is it?" she asked. I looked again, and the fire was gone. My house stood as it always had, with no fire, no smoke.

It turned out that my wife had been hulling grain, and a strong wind had blown the chaff into the air, and I had mistaken it for smoke.

I had gone out in search of food, but found none. And because I had shouted so loudly, my wife had been startled and thrown the grain away with the hull. Now we would have nothing to eat tonight.

I was furious, and threw myself onto the floor in despair.

"Blind, foolish creature!
Blind, wicked creature!
Stinky thing beneath the tail!
Rotten thing beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Dirty water dripping from your backside!
What a way to see the world!"

And that is the tale the fox told.

The Fox's Tale: Towa Towa To (Forever, Forever, Forever) 

Towa towa to...

One day, I set forth to the shore, hoping to find a bite to eat, alas.

*Clitter clatter* through the stones,
*Clitter clatter* through the driftwood,

As I went, I looked ahead and beheld a sight! A whale had, it seemed, beached itself on the shore! People were dressed in their finest clothes, celebrating the bounty of the sea. They danced and rejoiced, some cutting the meat, others carrying it away. Important-looking folk offered thanks and prayers to the sea, while others sharpened their knives. The beach was black with people!

Seeing this, I was overjoyed. "Oh, if only I could get there quickly and receive even a small morsel!" I thought, and cried out, "Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!"

*Clitter clatter* through the stones,
*Clitter clatter* through the driftwood,

I hurried closer, but what I found was not at all what I expected, alas. What I thought was a beached whale was nothing more than a pile of dog droppings on the sand!

And the people celebrating the sea's bounty, dancing and carrying meat? They were just crows, pecking at the dung, scattering it this way and that, flying hither and thither.

I was furious!

"Blind, foolish knave!
Blind, wicked knave!
Stinky thing beneath the tail!
Rotten thing beneath the tail!
Resin oozing from your backside!
Dirty water dripping from your backside!
What a way to see the world!"

Then again,

*Clitter clatter* through the stones,
*Clitter clatter* through the driftwood,

I ran along the shore and saw a boat in the distance. Two people inside seemed to be exchanging condolences.

"Oh my," I wondered, "what sudden tragedy has befallen them? Perhaps someone has capsized with the boat! I must hurry closer and hear what they have to say!" So I cried out, "Heave-ho!"

*Clitter clatter* through the stones,
*Clitter clatter* through the driftwood,

I flew as fast as I could, only to discover that what I thought was a boat was just a rock on the beach, and the people were nothing more than two large cormorants.

And that is the tale the fox told.

The English translation is good, but it can be improved by:

*   Making the language sound more archaic to reflect the fact that this is a folk tale.
*   Translating "Towa Towa To" more meaningfully.
*   Translating "Banzai" more meaningfully.
*   Translating "Foo-hoo-hoy" more meaningfully.
*   Translating "Hoo-ey" more meaningfully.
*   Translating "Chara chara" more meaningfully.
*   Translating the self-deprecating insults more literally.
*   Adding "alas" to add to the tragic feeling.
