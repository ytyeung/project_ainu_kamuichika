小狼の神が自ら歌った謡
「ホテナオ」

ホテナオ
ある日に退屈なので浜辺へ出て,
遊んでいたら一人の小男が
来ていたから,川下へ下ると
私も川下へ下り,
川上へ来ると私も川上へ行き道をさえぎった.
すると川下へ六回
川上へ六回になった時小男は
持前の癇癪かんしゃくを顔に表して言うことには,
「ピイピイ
この小僧め悪い小僧め,そんな事をするなら
この岬の,昔の名と今の名を
言い解いて見ろ」
私は聞いて笑いながらいうこと
には,
「誰がこの岬の昔の名と
今の名を知らないものか!
昔は,尊いえらい神様や人間が居ったから
この岬を神の岬と
言ったものだが,今は時代が衰えたから
御幣の岬とよんでいるのさ!」
云うと,小男の云うことには,
「ピイトン,ピイトン
この小僧め本当にお前はそういうなら
この川の前の名と今の名を
云って見ろ.」
聞くと,私の云うことには,
「誰がこの川の前の名
今の名を知らないものか!
昔,えらかった時代にはこの川を
流れの早い川と云っていたのだが
今は世が衰えているので流れの遅い川と
云っているのさ.」
云うと小男の云うことには,
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン
本当にお前そんな事を云うなら
お互の素性の解き合いをやろう.」
聞いて私の云うことには,
「誰がお前の素性を知らないものか!
大昔,オキキリムイが山へ行って
狩猟小舎を建てた時榛はしばみの木の炉縁ろぶちを作ったら
その炉縁が火に当ってからからに乾いてしまった.
オキキリムイが片方を踏むと片一方が
上る,それをオキキリムイが怒って
その炉縁を川へ持って下り
捨ててしまったのだ.
それからその炉縁は流れに沿うて流れていって
海へ出で,彼方かなたの海波,此方こなたの海波
に打ちつけられる様を神様たちが御覧になって,
敬うべきえらいオキキリムイの手作りの物がその様に
何の役にもたたず迷い流れて海水と共に腐ってしまうのは
勿体もったいない事だから神様たちから
その炉縁は魚にされて,
炉縁魚と
名づけられたのだ.
ところがその炉縁魚は,自分の素性が
わからないので,人にばけてうろついている.
その炉縁魚がお前なのさ.」
云うと,小男は顔色を
変え変え聞いていたが
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン!
お前は,小さい,狼の子なの
さ.」
云い終ると直ぐに海へパチャンと飛び込んだ.
あと見送ると一つの赤い魚が
尾鰭おびれを動かしてずーっと沖へ
行ってしまった.
と,幼い狼の神様が物語りました.

This is the English translation.
A Chant Sung by the Little Wolf God Himself:
"Hotenao"

Hotenao,

One day, bored, I went down to the beach.
As I was playing, a little man came along.
When I went downstream,
He followed me downstream.
When I went upstream, he followed me upstream, blocking my path.
This happened six times downstream,
And six times upstream. Finally, the little man,
His inherent temper flaring on his face, said,
"Pii-pii!
You little brat, you wicked little brat! If you're going to act like that,
Tell me the old name and the current name of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this cape?
Long ago, because noble and great gods and people lived here,
This cape was called the Cape of the Gods.
But now, because the times have declined,
It is called the Cape of Gohei!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you really know so much,
Tell me the old name and the current name of this river!"
Listening, I replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this river?
In the old days, when times were great, this river
Was called the River of Swift Currents.
But now, because the world has declined, it is called the River of Slow Currents!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you really know so much,
Let's test each other's origins!"
Listening, I replied,
"Who doesn't know your origins?
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
Rose up. Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
Then that hearth frame drifted along the current,
Out to sea, where the waves from afar and the waves from here
Beat upon it. The gods, seeing this,
Thought it a waste that something made by the revered and great Okikirmui
Was pointlessly drifting and rotting away with the seawater.
So the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And named it the Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, not knowing its own origins,
Transforms into a person and wanders about.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you!"
Hearing this, the little man's face
Changed color again and again.
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You are a small, little wolf
Child!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
Watching him go, I saw a single red fish
Moving its tail fin and heading far out to sea.

And so, the young wolf god told his story.

A Song Sung by the Young Wolf God Himself:
"Hotenao"

Hotenao,

One day, feeling bored, I went down to the beach.
While playing, a small man appeared.
When I went downstream,
He followed me downstream.
When I went upstream, he followed me upstream, blocking my way.
This happened six times downstream,
And six times upstream. Finally, the small man,
his temper flaring, said,
"Pii-pii!
You little brat, wicked brat! If you're going to act like that,
tell me the old name and the current name of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this cape?
Long ago, because noble and great gods and people lived here,
this cape was called the Cape of the Gods.
But now, because times have declined,
it's called the Cape of Gohei!"
Hearing this, the small man said,
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you really know so much,
tell me the old name and the current name of this river!"
Listening, I replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this river?
In the old days, when times were great, this river
was called the River of Swift Currents.
But now, because the world is declining, it's called the River of Slow Currents!"
Hearing this, the small man said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you really know so much,
let's test each other's origins!"
Listening, I replied,
"Who doesn't know your origins?
Long ago, Okikirmui went to the mountains
and built a hunting lodge. He made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
rose up. Annoyed by this, Okikirmui
took the hearth frame down to the river
and threw it away.
Then that hearth frame drifted along the current,
out to sea, where distant waves and nearby waves
battered it. The gods, seeing this,
thought it a waste that something made by the revered Okikirmui
was pointlessly drifting and rotting away in the seawater.
So the gods
transformed that hearth frame into a fish,
and named it the Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, not knowing its own origins,
transforms into people and wanders about.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you!"
Hearing this, the small man's face
changed color again and again.
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You are a young wolf
cub!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
Watching him go, I saw a single red fish
moving its tail fin and heading far out to sea.

And so, the young wolf god told his story.

The initial translation is generally good but can be improved for flow and accuracy. Some phrases are a bit clunky and can be made more natural. The repetition of "little" can be reduced. The onomatopoeia can be handled more consistently. The description of the hearth frame's transformation into a fish can be made more vivid.
