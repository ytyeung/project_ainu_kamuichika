梟の神が自ら歌った謡
         「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
昔私の物言う時は桜皮を巻いた弓の
弓把きゅうはの央を鳴り渡らす如くに
言ったのであったが,
今は衰え年老いてしまった事よ.
けれども誰か雄弁で
使者としての自信を持ってる者があったら,
天国へ五ツ半の談判
を言いつけてやりたいものだ.」と
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
私は言った,ところが入口で誰かが
「私をおいて誰が使者として雄弁で
自信のあるものがあるでしょう.」というので
見ると鴉からすの若者であった.
私は家に入れて,それから,たがつきのシントコの
蓋の上をたたきながら
鴉の若者を使者にたてる為
その談判を云いきかせて三日たって
三つ目の談判を話しながら見ると
鴉の若者は炉縁の後で
居眠りをしている,それを見ると,癪しゃくに
さわったので鴉の若者を
羽ぐるみ引っぱたいて殺してしまった.
それから又たがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら
「誰か使者として自信のある者が
あれば天国へ五ツ半の
談判を言いつけてやりたい.」と
言うと,誰かがまた入口へ
「誰が私をおいて,雄弁で
天国へ使者に立つほどの者がありましょう.」
と言うので見ると山のかけす
であった.
家へ入れてそれからまた
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の談判を話して
四日たって,四つの用向を言っているうちに
山のかけすは炉縁の後で居眠りをしている.
私は腹が立って山のかけすを羽ぐるみひっぱたいて
殺してしまった.
それからまたたがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら,
「誰か雄弁で使者として
自信のある者があれば,天国へ
五ツ半の談判を持たせてやりたい.」
と言うと,誰かが
慎つつしみ深い態度ではいって来たので見ると
川ガラスの若者,美しい様子で
左の座に坐った.それで私は
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の用件を夜でも
昼でも言い続けた.見れば
川ガラスの若者,何も疲れた様子もなく
聞いていて昼と夜を
数えて六日目に
私が言い終ると直ぐに天窗から
出て天国へ行ってしまった.
その談判の大むねは,人間の世界に
饑饉があって人間たちは今にも
餓死しようとしている.どういう訳かと
見ると天国に
鹿を司つかさどる神様と魚を司る神様とが
相談をして鹿も出さず魚も出さぬことに
したからであったので,神様たちから
どんなに言われても知らぬ顔をして
いるので人間たちは猟に
山へ行っても鹿も無い,魚漁に
川へ行っても魚も無い.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
鹿の神,魚の神へ使者をたてた
のである.
それから幾日もたって
空の方に微かな音がきこえていたが
誰かがはいって来た.見ると
川ガラスの若者,今は前よりも美しさを増し
勇ましい気品をそなえて
返し談判を述べはじめた.
天国の鹿の神や魚の神が
今日まで鹿を出さず魚を出さなかった
理由は,人間たちが鹿を捕る時に
木で鹿の頭をたたき,皮を剥ぐと
鹿の頭をそのまま山の木原に
捨ておき,魚をとると
腐れ木で魚の頭をたたいて殺すので,
鹿どもは,裸で泣きながら
鹿の神の許もとへ帰り,魚どもは
腐れ木をくわえて魚の神の
許へ帰る.鹿の神,魚の神は
怒って相談をし,鹿を出さず
魚を出さなかったのであった.がこののち
人間たちが鹿でも魚でも
ていねいに取扱うという事なら鹿も出す
魚も出すであろう,と鹿の神と
魚の神が言ったという事を詳しく申し立てた.
私はそれを聞いてから川ガラスの若者に
讃辞を呈して,見ると本当に
人間たちは鹿や魚を
粗末に取扱ったのであった.
それから,以後は,決してそんな事をしない様に
人間たちに,眠りの時,夢の中に
教えてやったら,人間たちも
悪かったという事に気が付き,それからは
幣ぬさの様に魚をとる道具を美しく作り
それで魚をとる.鹿をとったときは,鹿の頭も
きれいに飾って祭る,それで
魚たちは,よろこんで美しい御幣ごへいをくわえて
魚の神のもとに行き,鹿たちは
よろこんで新しく月代さかやきをして鹿の神
のもとに立ち帰る.それを鹿の神や
魚の神はよろこんで
沢山,魚を出し,沢山,鹿を出した.
人間たちは,今はもうなんの困る事も
ひもじい事もなく暮している,
私はそれを見て安心をした.
私は,もう年老い,衰え弱った
ので,天国へ行こうと
思っていたのだけれども,私が守護している人間の国に
饑饉があって人間たちが餓死しようとしているのに
構わずに行く事が出来ないので,
これまで居たのだけれども,今はもう
なんの気がかりも無いから,最も強い者
若い勇者を私のあとにおき人間の世を
守護させて,今天国へ行く所なのだ.
と,国の守護神なる翁神(梟)が
物語って天国へ行きました.と.

貓頭鷹神親自吟唱的歌謠
**「孔庫瓦」**

「孔庫瓦啊…
想當年我說話的時候，聲音洪亮，就像用櫻花樹皮纏繞的弓，撥動弓弦，那聲音響徹弓身！ 可惜啊，如今我老了，也衰弱了。

不過，要是你們之中，有誰口才便給，又對擔任使者充滿自信，我就想委託他一項重要的談判——一件『五個半』的大事——要他帶到天上去！」

我一邊敲著鑲邊木桶（シントコ）的蓋子，一邊這樣說道。 就在這時，入口傳來一個聲音：「捨我其誰！ 誰能比我更會說話，更有自信，能當您的使者呢？」 我轉頭一看，原來是隻年輕的烏鴉站在那裡。

我把他請進屋裡，又敲了敲鑲邊木桶的蓋子，開始詳細地向他說明談判的細節，為這隻年輕的烏鴉執行任務做準備。 三天過去了，當我講到第三個談判要點的時候，我卻發現這隻烏鴉竟然在爐邊打瞌睡！ 我頓時火冒三丈，一把抓住他的羽毛，狠狠地把他打死了。

我又敲著鑲邊木桶的蓋子，大聲喊道：「有沒有誰有足夠的自信，能當我的使者，把這件『五個半』的大事帶到天上去啊？」

結果，又一個聲音從入口傳來：「誰能比我更會說話，更有資格站在您面前，當前往天庭的使者呢？」 這次，是隻從山上來的橿鳥。

我把他請了進來，再次敲著鑲邊木桶的蓋子，開始解釋這件『五個半』的談判。 四天過去了，當我詳細說明第四個要點的時候，我看到這隻山橿鳥竟然在爐邊呼呼大睡！ 我怒不可遏，抓住這隻山橿鳥的羽毛，狠狠地把他打死了。

我再一次敲著鑲邊木桶的蓋子， громко宣佈：「如果有人口才便給，又對擔任使者充滿自信，我就想委託他這件『五個半』的大事，要他帶到天上去！」

這次，一個態度謙恭的身影走了進來。 是隻年輕的河烏鴉，長相俊美，在我的左邊坐了下來。 於是，我一邊敲著鑲邊木桶的蓋子，一邊不分晝夜地繼續解釋這件『五個半』的大事。 這隻年輕的河烏鴉聽得非常專心，一點也沒有疲倦的樣子。

我們就這樣過了六天六夜，我一說完，他就立刻從天窗飛了出去，直奔天庭。

這次談判的重點是：人間正面臨饑荒，人們都快要餓死了。 究其原因，原來是天上的鹿神和魚神商量好，不肯降下恩惠。 無論人們怎麼懇求，他們都無動於衷。 人們到山裡打獵，找不到鹿；到河裡捕魚，也捕不到魚。

我看到這種情況，義憤填膺，就想派個使者去跟鹿神和魚神交涉。

過了許多天，從天空傳來一陣微弱的聲音。 有人走了進來，原來是那隻年輕的河烏鴉，現在的他比以前更加俊美，渾身散發著英勇的氣概。 他開始轉述神的回覆。

鹿神和魚神之所以一直不肯降下鹿和魚，是因為人類對待牠們的方式太過殘忍。 人類在獵捕鹿的時候，會用木頭敲擊鹿的頭部，剝下鹿皮之後，就把鹿頭隨意丟棄在山林裡。 捕魚的時候，就用腐爛的木頭敲擊魚的頭部，把牠們打死。 那些鹿光著身子，哭哭啼啼地回到鹿神的身邊；那些魚呢，嘴裡還含著腐爛的木頭，回到魚神的身邊。 鹿神和魚神非常生氣，經過商量，才決定不降下鹿和魚。

但是，如果人類能保證從今以後會善待鹿和魚，那麼鹿神和魚神就會再次降下恩惠。 這就是鹿神和魚神傳達的信息。

聽完之後，我對這隻年輕的河烏鴉讚不絕口。 的確，人類一直以來都對待鹿和魚非常粗暴。

從那以後，我就在人們的夢中告誡他們，告誡他們不要再犯同樣的錯誤。 人們也意識到自己做錯了，從此以後，像製作神聖的幣帛一樣，精心地製作捕魚的工具，用它來捕魚。 獵到鹿的時候，也會把鹿頭裝飾得漂漂亮亮，用來祭祀。 魚兒們因此感到非常高興，銜著美麗的御幣，回到魚神的身邊；鹿兒們也高高興興地剃了新月代頭（武士髮型），回到鹿神的身邊。 鹿神和魚神對此感到非常滿意，於是降下了大量的魚，降下了大量的鹿。

人類從此以後，再也沒有任何困難，過著豐衣足食的生活。 我看到這種情況，感到非常安心。

我已經年老體衰，本來打算升上天庭。 但是，我不能丟下我所守護的人間不管，眼睜睜看著他們遭受饑荒。 所以我一直留了下來。 現在，我已經沒有任何牽掛了，所以決定把守護人間的重任，交給你們之中最強壯、最勇敢的年輕人，而我今天就要升上天庭了。

就這樣，作為國家守護神的貓頭鷹老神，講完了他的故事，升上了天庭。

The Owl God's Song: "Konkwa"

"Konkwa...

In days of old, when I spoke, my voice resonated like the twang of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark, echoing through the very heart of the bow. But alas, I have grown old and feeble.

Still, if there be any among you, eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with a crucial negotiation – a "five and a half" matter – to be delivered to the heavens!"

So I declared, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest. Just then, a voice called out from the entrance, "Who could be more eloquent and confident than I to serve as your messenger?" I turned to see a young raven standing there.

I welcomed him inside and, tapping once more upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I began to explain the details of the negotiation, preparing the young raven for his mission. Three days passed, and as I was recounting the third point of the negotiation, I noticed the raven dozing off by the hearth. Enraged by his lack of attention, I seized him by his feathers and beat him to death.

Again, I tapped upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest and cried out, "Is there anyone confident enough to serve as my messenger, to carry this 'five and a half' matter to the heavens?"

And again, a voice answered from the entrance, "Who could be more eloquent than I, more worthy to stand as your messenger before the heavens?" This time, it was a jay from the mountains.

I invited him in and, tapping once more upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I began to explain the "five and a half" negotiation. Four days passed, and as I was detailing the fourth point, I saw the mountain jay fast asleep by the hearth. My anger flared, and I seized the mountain jay by his feathers and beat him to death.

Once more, I tapped upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest and proclaimed, "If there be any among you, eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with this 'five and a half' matter to be delivered to the heavens!"

This time, a figure entered with a humble demeanor. It was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance, who took a seat to my left. And so, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I continued to explain the "five and a half" matter, day and night. The young river crow listened without a hint of fatigue.

Six days and nights we spent in this way, and as soon as I had finished speaking, he departed through the skylight and ascended to the heavens.

The essence of the negotiation was this: a famine had struck the human world, and the people were on the verge of starvation. The reason, it turned out, was that the gods who governed the deer and the fish in heaven had conspired to withhold their bounty. No matter how much they were entreated, they remained unmoved. Humans who hunted in the mountains found no deer, and those who fished in the rivers found no fish.

Seeing this, I was filled with righteous anger and sought to send a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

Many days passed, and then, a faint sound echoed from the sky. Someone entered, and it was the young river crow, now even more beautiful and imbued with a valiant spirit. He began to deliver the gods' response.

The deer god and the fish god had withheld their bounty because of the way humans treated the deer and the fish. When humans hunted deer, they would strike the deer's head with wood, skin it, and then leave the head discarded in the forest. When they caught fish, they would kill them by striking their heads with rotten wood. The deer, naked and weeping, would return to the deer god. The fish, with rotten wood still clutched in their mouths, would return to the fish god. The gods, enraged, had conspired to withhold their bounty.

However, if humans would promise to treat the deer and the fish with respect, then the deer god and the fish god would release their bounty once more. This was the message delivered by the deer god and the fish god.

Hearing this, I praised the young river crow. And indeed, it was true that humans had been treating the deer and the fish with disrespect.

From then on, I taught the humans in their dreams to never repeat such actions. The humans realized their wrongdoings and began to craft beautiful tools, like sacred *nusa* offerings, to catch the fish. When they hunted deer, they adorned the deer's head and offered it in sacrifice. The fish, delighted, carried the beautiful *gohei* offerings to the fish god. The deer, joyful, returned to the deer god with newly shaved forelocks. The deer god and the fish god were pleased and released their bounty in abundance.

The humans now lived without hardship or hunger, and I was at peace.

I am old and feeble, and I had intended to ascend to the heavens. But I could not bear to leave the human realm, which I protect, while the people were suffering from famine. That is why I have remained until now. But now, with no more worries, I shall entrust the protection of the human world to the strongest and bravest among you, and ascend to the heavens.

And so, the old owl god, guardian of the land, finished his tale and ascended to the heavens.

The Owl God's Chant: "Konkwa" 

"Konkwa...

In days of old, when I spoke, my voice resonated like the twang of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark, echoing through the very heart of the bow – a sound that reverberated through the entire instrument! But alas, I have grown old and feeble.

Still, if there be any among you who are eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with a crucial negotiation – a matter of utmost importance, a 'five and a half' affair – to be delivered to the heavens!"

So I declared, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest. Just then, a voice called out from the entrance, "Who is more suited than I! Who could be more eloquent and confident than I to serve as your messenger?" I turned to see a young raven standing there.

The English translation captures the essence of the Japanese text, but it can be improved by incorporating some of the strengths of the Chinese translation. Specifically, the Chinese translation excels in conveying the emotional intensity and dramatic flair of the original story. It also provides a more vivid and accessible rendering of certain cultural elements. The English translation is a bit too literal and misses some of the nuances. For example, the Chinese translation uses more descriptive language to depict the appearance and actions of the characters, making the story more engaging. The English translation could benefit from similar enhancements to bring the narrative to life. The Chinese translation also does a better job of explaining certain cultural references, such as the 'five and a half' matter, which is left somewhat ambiguous in the English translation. Providing additional context or explanation for these references would improve the reader's understanding and appreciation of the story.
