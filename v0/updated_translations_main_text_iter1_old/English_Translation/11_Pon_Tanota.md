小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「この砂赤い赤い」

〔この砂赤い赤い〕
ある日に流れをさかのぼって遊びに
出かけたら,悪魔の子に出会った.
いつでも悪魔の子は様子が美しい
顔が美しい.黒い衣を着けて
胡桃くるみの小弓に胡桃の小矢を持っていて
私を見ると,ニコニコして
いうことには,
「小オキキリムイ,遊ぼう.
さあこれから,魚の根を絶やして見せよう.」
と言って,胡桃の小弓に胡桃の小矢を
番つがえ水源の方へ矢を射放すと,
水源から胡桃の水,濁った水が
流れ出し,鮭どもが上って来ると
胡桃の水が厭なので泣きながら
引き返して流れて行く.悪魔の子は
それをニコニコしている.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
私の持っていた,銀の小弓に銀の小矢を
番え水源へ矢を射はなすと
水源から銀の水,清い水が
流れ出し,泣きながら流れて行った
鮭どもは清い水に元気を恢復し
大笑いをして遊びさわいで
パチャパチャ川を上って行った.
すると,悪魔の子は,持前の癇癪かんしゃくを
顔に表して,
「本当にお前そんな事をするなら,鹿の根を
絶やして見せよう.」と云って,
胡桃の小弓に胡桃の小矢を番え
大空を射ると,山の木原から
胡桃の風,つむじ風が吹いて来て
山の木原から,牡鹿の群は別に
牝鹿の群はまた別に,風に吹き上げられ
ずーっと天空へきれいにならんで上って行く.
悪魔の子はニコニコしている.
それを見た私はかっと癪にさわったので
銀の小弓に銀の小矢を
番えて,鹿の群のあとへ矢を射放すと,
天上から,銀の風,清い風が
吹き降り,牡鹿の群は
別に,牝鹿の群はまた別に,
山の木原の上へ吹き下された.
すると,悪魔の子は
持前の癇癪を顔に現し,
「生意気な,本当に
お前そんな事をするなら,力競べをやろう.」
と云いながら上衣を脱いだ.
私も薄衣一枚になって
組み付いた.彼も私に組み付いた.それからは
互に下にしたり上にしあったり相撲をとったが,
大へんに悪魔の子が力のある事には
驚いた.けれども,とうとう,ある時間に,
私は腰の力,からだの力を
みんな出して,悪魔の子を
肩の上まで引っ担ぎ,
山の岩の上へ彼を打ちつけた音が
がんと響いた.殺してしまって地獄へ
踏み落したあとはしんと静まり返った.
それが済んで,私は流れに沿って帰って来ると,
川の中では鮭どもが笑う声
遊ぶ声がかまびすしくのぼって来るのが
パチャパチャきこえる.山の木原では,
牡鹿ども,牝鹿どもが笑う声
遊ぶ声がそこら一ぱいになって
そこにここに物を
食べている.私はそれを見て
安心をし,私の家へ
帰って来た.
と,小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

小オキキリム伊親自吟唱的歌謠
「這砂，紅豔豔的」

〔這砂，紅豔豔的〕
某日，我溯溪嬉遊，
巧遇了惡魔之子。
無論何時，惡魔之子都容貌俊美，
面若桃花，身著黑衣，
手持胡桃小弓，胡桃小箭。
他見到我，便笑嘻嘻地說：
「小オキキリム伊，一起玩吧！
我這就讓你瞧瞧，如何斷絕鮭魚的生路！」
說著，便搭上胡桃小弓，胡桃小箭，
朝水源方向射去。
水源頓時湧出胡桃水，混濁不堪，污穢至極。
鮭魚們奮力上游，
卻厭惡這胡桃水，哭泣著，
紛紛掉頭逃向下游。
惡魔之子見狀，只是得意地笑著。
我見此情景，怒火中燒，
便取出我的銀色小弓，搭上銀色小箭，
朝水源射去。
水源隨即流出銀色之水，清澈見底，純淨無瑕。
方才哭泣著離去的
鮭魚們，在這清澈的銀水中恢復了活力，
歡欣鼓舞，嬉戲玩鬧，
啪嚓啪嚓地逆流而上。
惡魔之子頓時惱羞成怒，
將他的焦躁全寫在臉上，
「你當真要與我作對？我就讓你看看，如何斷絕鹿的生路！」說著，
便搭上胡桃小弓，胡桃小箭，
朝天空射去。山的樹林間，
頓時颳起胡桃之風，一道龍捲風，
從山的樹林中，公鹿與母鹿
被強風分開，各自被吹上半空，
整齊地排列著，冉冉升向天際。
惡魔之子只是得意地笑著。
我見此情景，更是怒不可遏！
便搭上銀色小弓，銀色小箭，
朝鹿群追射而去。
從天上，吹下銀色之風，清澈的風，
公鹿與母鹿
再度被分開，各自
被吹回山的樹林之上。
於是，惡魔之子
再也藏不住他的怒火，
「好大的膽子！
你真要如此，不如我們來一場力氣較量！」
說著，便脫下上衣。
我也只剩一件單薄的衣裳，
便與他扭打成一團。他也緊緊抱住我，從那之後，
我們互相壓制，互相摔跤，
但惡魔之子的力氣之大，
實在令我吃驚。可是，最終，在某個瞬間，
我使出全身的腰力，所有的力量，
將惡魔之子
扛到肩上，
然後將他狠狠摔向山岩，發出
轟然巨響！我殺了他，將他踩入地獄深淵，之後一片寂靜。
事情結束後，我沿著溪流返回，
河裡，鮭魚們的歡笑聲，
嬉鬧聲，喧囂熱鬧地傳來，
啪嚓啪嚓地清晰可聞。山的樹林中，
公鹿們，母鹿們的歡笑聲，
嬉鬧聲，充滿四處，
在那裡，在這裡，
悠閒地吃著東西。我見此情景，
終於感到安心，回到了
我的家。
小オキキリム伊如此講述著他的故事。

This is the English translation.
This is the song of Little Okikirmui, sung by himself:

"This sand is red, red."

It goes like this:

One day, I was playing, going upstream, when I met the child of a demon. Always, this demon child was beautiful to behold, with a beautiful face. He wore black clothes and carried a small bow of walnut wood and arrows of walnut wood. When he saw me, he smiled and said,

"Little Okikirmui, let's play! I'll show you how to cut off the salmon's path!"

And with that, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow and shot it towards the source of the river. From the source flowed walnut water, murky and foul. The salmon, trying to swim upstream, hated the walnut water and, crying, turned back and fled downstream. The demon child just smiled and smiled.

Seeing this, I was angered. I took my silver bow and nocked a silver arrow, shooting it towards the source of the river. From the source flowed silver water, pure and clean. The salmon, who had been crying, regained their strength in the clear water, laughing and playing, splashing and swimming upstream.

Then, the demon child, his temper flaring, showed his anger on his face and said, "If you're really going to do that, I'll show you how to cut off the deer's path!"

He nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow and shot it into the sky. From the mountain forests came a walnut wind, a whirlwind, and from the mountain forests, the male deer and the female deer were separated and blown upwards, rising in a beautiful line into the sky. The demon child just smiled and smiled.

Seeing this, I was enraged! I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow and shot it after the deer. From the heavens came a silver wind, a pure wind, and the male deer and the female deer were separated and blown down, back to the mountain forests.

Then, the demon child, his temper plain on his face, said, "You're getting on my nerves! If you're really going to do that, let's have a contest of strength!"

And with that, he took off his coat. I, too, stripped down to a thin garment, and we grappled. He grabbed me, and I grabbed him. We wrestled, throwing each other down and lifting each other up, but I was surprised by how strong the demon child was. But finally, at a certain moment, I gathered all the strength in my waist and body, lifted the demon child onto my shoulders, and slammed him onto a mountain rock with a resounding crash! I killed him and cast him down to hell, and then all was silent.

When that was done, I returned along the river, and in the river, I could hear the salmon laughing and playing, their voices rising in a joyful clamor. In the mountain forests, the male deer and the female deer were laughing and playing, their voices filling the air as they ate here and there. Seeing this, I was relieved and returned to my home.

So, Little Okikirmui told his story.

This is the song of Little Okikirmui, sung by himself:

"This sand is red, so red!"

It goes like this:

One day, as I played, going upstream, I encountered the child of a demon. Always, this demon child was beautiful to behold, with a face like a blossoming peach. He wore black clothes and carried a small bow of walnut wood and arrows of walnut wood. When he saw me, he smiled and said,

"Little Okikirmui, let's play! I'll show you how to cut off the salmon's life!"

And with that, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow and shot it towards the source of the river. From the source flowed walnut water, murky and utterly foul. The salmon, struggling to swim upstream, detested the walnut water and, crying, turned back and fled downstream. The demon child just smiled gleefully.

Seeing this, my anger flared. I took my silver bow and nocked a silver arrow, shooting it towards the source of the river. From the source flowed silver water, clear and utterly pure. The salmon, who had been crying, regained their strength in the clear water, laughing and playing, splashing and swimming upstream.

Then, the demon child, his temper flaring, showed his anger on his face and said, "If you're really going to do that, I'll show you how to cut off the deer's life!"

He nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow and shot it into the sky. From the mountain forests came a walnut wind, a whirlwind, and from the mountain forests, the male deer and the female deer were separated and blown upwards, rising in a beautiful line into the sky. The demon child just smiled gleefully.

Seeing this, I was consumed by rage! I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow and shot it after the deer. From the heavens came a silver wind, a pure wind, and the male deer and the female deer were separated and blown down, back to the mountain forests.

Then, the demon child, his temper plain on his face, said, "You're getting on my nerves! If you're really going to do that, let's have a contest of strength!"

And with that, he took off his coat. I, too, stripped down to a thin garment, and we grappled. He grabbed me, and I grabbed him. We wrestled, throwing each other down and lifting each other up, but I was surprised by how strong the demon child was. But finally, at a certain moment, I gathered all the strength in my waist and body, lifted the demon child onto my shoulders, and slammed him onto a mountain rock with a resounding crash! I killed him and cast him down to hell, and then all was silent.

When that was done, I returned along the river, and in the river, I could hear the salmon laughing and playing, their voices rising in a joyful clamor, splashing and gurgling. In the mountain forests, the male deer and the female deer were laughing and playing, their voices filling the air as they ate here and there. Seeing this, I was relieved and returned to my home.

So, Little Okikirmui told his story.

The English translation is generally accurate but lacks the poetic flair and vivid imagery present in the Japanese original and the Chinese translation. It tends to be more literal and less evocative. The Chinese translation captures the spirit and emotion of the original text more effectively, using more descriptive language and maintaining a consistent tone. Here's a comparison:

*   **Opening:** The English translation is straightforward. The Chinese translation uses "紅豔豔的", which is more vivid and emphasizes the redness of the sand.
*   **Description of the Demon Child:** Both translations capture the beauty of the demon child, but the Chinese translation, "面若桃花", adds a specific and poetic image (face like peach blossoms) that is missing in the English.
*   **Water Description:** The Chinese translation uses "混濁不堪，污穢至極" to describe the walnut water, which is more impactful than "murky and foul." Similarly, "清澈見底，純淨無瑕" is more evocative than "pure and clean."
*   **Sound Effects:** Both translations include the "パチャパチャ" sound, but the Chinese translation adds "喧囂熱鬧地傳來" to describe the joyful clamor, which is more descriptive.
*   **Emotional Impact:** The Chinese translation uses phrases like "怒火中燒" and "怒不可遏" to convey the protagonist's anger more intensely than the English translation's "I was angered" and "I was enraged!"

I will improve the English translation by incorporating some of the descriptive elements from the Chinese translation and making the language more vivid and engaging.
