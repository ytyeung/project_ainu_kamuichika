序

その昔この広い北海道は,私たちの先祖の自由の天地でありました.天真爛漫な稚児の様に,美しい大自然に抱擁されてのんびりと楽しく生活していた彼等は,真に自然の寵児,なんという幸福な人だちであったでしょう.
冬の陸には林野をおおう深雪を蹴って,天地を凍らす寒気を物ともせず山又山をふみ越えて熊を狩り,夏の海には涼風泳ぐみどりの波,白い鴎の歌を友に木の葉の様な小舟を浮べてひねもす魚を漁り,花咲く春は軟らかな陽の光を浴びて,永久に囀さえずる小鳥と共に歌い暮して蕗ふきとり蓬よもぎ摘み,紅葉の秋は野分に穂揃うすすきをわけて,宵まで鮭とる篝かがりも消え,谷間に友呼ぶ鹿の音を外に,円まどかな月に夢を結ぶ.嗚呼なんという楽しい生活でしょう.平和の境,それも今は昔,夢は破れて幾十年,この地は急速な変転をなし,山野は村に,村は町にと次第々々に開けてゆく.
太古ながらの自然の姿も何時の間にか影薄れて,野辺に山辺に嬉々として暮していた多くの民の行方も亦いずこ.僅かに残る私たち同族は,進みゆく世のさまにただ驚きの眼をみはるばかり.しかもその眼からは一挙一動宗教的感念に支配されていた昔の人の美しい魂の輝きは失われて,不安に充ち不平に燃え,鈍りくらんで行手も見わかず,よその御慈悲にすがらねばならぬ,あさましい姿,おお亡びゆくもの......それは今の私たちの名,なんという悲しい名前を私たちは持っているのでしょう.
その昔,幸福な私たちの先祖は,自分のこの郷土が末にこうした惨めなありさまに変ろうなどとは,露ほども想像し得なかったのでありましょう.
時は絶えず流れる,世は限りなく進展してゆく.激しい競争場裡に敗残の醜をさらしている今の私たちの中からも,いつかは,二人三人でも強いものが出て来たら,進みゆく世と歩をならべる日も,やがては来ましょう.それはほんとうに私たちの切なる望み,明暮あけくれ祈っている事で御座います.
けれど......愛する私たちの先祖が起伏す日頃互いに意を通ずる為に用いた多くの言語,言い古し,残し伝えた多くの美しい言葉,それらのものもみんな果敢なく,亡びゆく弱きものと共に消失せてしまうのでしょうか.おおそれはあまりにいたましい名残惜しい事で御座います.
アイヌに生れアイヌ語の中に生いたった私は,雨の宵,雪の夜,暇ある毎に打集って私たちの先祖が語り興じたいろいろな物語の中極く小さな話の一つ二つを拙ない筆に書連ねました.
私たちを知って下さる多くの方に読んでいただく事が出来ますならば,私は,私たちの同族祖先と共にほんとうに無限の喜び,無上の幸福に存じます.

序

很久很久以前，這片廣闊的北海道，是我們祖先自由自在的天地。他們就像天真爛漫的孩子，被美麗的大自然擁抱著，無憂無慮地生活，真是大自然的寵兒，多麼令人稱羨的生活啊！

在寒冷的冬天，他們踢開覆蓋森林的厚厚積雪，不畏懼那冰凍天地的寒氣，翻山越嶺地去獵熊；在涼風徐徐的夏天，他們在綠波蕩漾的海面上，與海鷗的歌聲為伴，划著像樹葉般的小船，整天辛勤地捕魚；在百花盛開的春天，他們沐浴在溫暖的陽光下，與不停歌唱的小鳥一同嬉戲，採集蕗和蓬；在紅葉似火的秋天，他們撥開被秋風吹拂、穗頭飽滿的芒草，直到深夜捕鮭魚的篝火都已熄滅，在山谷間迴盪的鹿鳴聲中，對著皎潔的月亮編織著美麗的夢想。啊，那是多麼快樂的生活啊！那和平寧靜的時光，如今都已成為過往雲煙。夢想破滅至今已數十年，這片土地經歷了快速的變遷，山野變成了村莊，村莊又變成了城鎮，一步步地被開墾發展。

太古時代那原始的自然風貌，不知在何時已經悄然褪色，曾經在田野山林間快樂生活的人們，如今又都去了哪裡呢？僅存的我們這些族人，對於這不斷變化的世界，只能睜大眼睛，感到驚訝和茫然。而且，從我們的眼神中，已經失去了昔日祖先那種被宗教情懷所支配的美麗靈魂的光輝，取而代之的是不安和不滿，變得遲鈍而黯淡，看不清未來的方向，不得不依靠別人的憐憫，這是多麼可悲的模樣啊！唉，這正在消逝的事物……這就是我們現在的名字，我們背負著多麼悲傷的名字啊！

很久以前，我們那些幸福的祖先，一定連想都沒想到，自己深愛的這片故土，最終會變成如此淒涼的景象吧。

時間不停地流逝，世界不斷地發展。在這激烈的競爭場中，即使現在的我們正暴露著失敗的醜態，但總有一天，如果能出現兩三位堅強的人，我們也能夠跟上時代的步伐，與世界並肩前行吧。這真的是我們最迫切的願望，也是我們日夜不停祈禱的事情。

但是……我們敬愛的祖先，為了在日常生活中彼此溝通而使用的那些古老的語言，那些被傳承下來的美麗詞語，難道也要隨著我們這些弱者一同消失殆盡嗎？啊，這實在是太令人悲痛和惋惜了！

我身為阿伊努人，在阿伊努語的環境中長大，每當在下雨的夜晚，下雪的夜晚，只要有空閒，就會聚集在一起，用我笨拙的筆，記錄下我們的祖先所講述的無數故事中，極小的一部分。

如果能讓更多了解我們的人讀到這些文字，我將與我的阿伊努同胞和祖先們一同，感受到無比的喜悅和至上的幸福。

## Preface

Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was the realm of freedom for our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. Truly, they were nature's darlings, such blessed people they were.

In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the forests, braving the freezing air that chilled the earth, crossing mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they sailed their leaf-like boats on the green waves where cool breezes swam, the songs of white gulls their companions, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending their days singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the crimson autumn, they parted the fields of pampas grass, whose ears swayed in the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon faded into the evening. With the calls of deer echoing through the valleys, they dreamt beneath the round moon. Ah, what a joyous life!

That peaceful world is now a thing of the past. Decades have passed since those dreams were shattered. This land has undergone rapid transformation, with mountains and fields gradually giving way to villages, and villages to towns.

Before we knew it, the ancient face of nature has faded, and where have all the people who once lived joyfully in the fields and mountains gone? The few of our kin who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Yet, the beautiful souls of those ancient people, whose every action was governed by religious sentiment, are now gone from their eyes, replaced by anxiety and resentment, dulled and clouded, unable to see the way forward. They must rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now. What a sorrowful name we bear.

In the past, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state.

Time flows ceaselessly, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of the defeated in this fierce arena of competition, perhaps someday two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our ardent hope, and we pray for it morning and night.

But... will all the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other daily, the ancient and beautiful words they passed down, all disappear along with the perishing weak? Oh, that is too heartbreaking and regrettable.

Born an Ainu and raised within the Ainu language, I have written down in clumsy prose one or two of the very small stories from the many tales our ancestors used to gather and enjoy on rainy evenings and snowy nights whenever I had some free time.

If many who know us can read this, I, along with our ancestors, will truly feel boundless joy and supreme happiness.

## Preface

Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was the free and open land for our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. Truly, they were favorites of nature, such blessed people they were.

In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the forests, braving the freezing air that chilled the earth, crossing mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they sailed their boats like leaves on the green waves where cool breezes swam, the songs of white gulls their companions, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending their days singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the autumn of red leaves, they parted the pampas grass, its ears heavy in the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon faded into the evening. With the calls of deer echoing through the valleys, they dreamt beneath the round moon. Ah, what a joyous life!

That peaceful world is now a thing of the past. Decades have passed since those dreams were shattered. This land has undergone rapid transformation, with mountains and fields gradually giving way to villages, and villages to towns.

Before we knew it, the pristine nature has faded, and where have all the people who once lived joyfully in the fields and mountains gone? The few of our kin who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Yet, the beautiful souls of those ancient people, whose every action was governed by spiritual beliefs, are now gone from their eyes, replaced by anxiety and resentment, dulled and clouded, unable to see the way forward. They must rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now. What a sorrowful name we bear.

In the past, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state.

Time flows ceaselessly, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the shame of defeat in this fierce arena of competition, perhaps someday two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our ardent hope, and we pray for it morning and night.

But... will all the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other daily, the ancient and beautiful words they passed down, all disappear along with the vanquished weak? Oh, that is too heartbreaking and regrettable.

Born an Ainu and raised within the Ainu language, I have written down in humble words one or two of the very small stories from the many tales our ancestors used to gather and enjoy on rainy evenings and snowy nights whenever I had some free time.

If many who know us can read this, I, along with our ancestors, will truly feel boundless joy and supreme happiness.

The English translation is generally good, but it could be improved to better reflect the nuances and poetic tone of the original Japanese text, as well as align more closely with the Chinese translation in certain areas. Here's a breakdown:

*   **"realm of freedom" vs. "自由的天地"**: The English phrase is accurate, but "free and open land" or "land of freedom and independence" might better capture the sense of unrestricted living implied in the Japanese and Chinese.
*   **"nature's darlings" vs. "大自然的寵兒"**: The English is fine, but "favorites of nature" or "children of nature" might be closer to the original meaning and the Chinese translation.
*   **"leaf-like boats" vs. "像樹葉般的小船"**: This is accurate, but "boats like leaves" might sound more natural in English.
*   **"crimson autumn"**: While evocative, "autumn of red leaves" might be more literal and align better with the imagery.
*   **"parted the fields of pampas grass, whose ears swayed in the autumn wind" vs. "撥開被秋風吹拂、穗頭飽滿的芒草"**: The English is a bit wordy. "Parted the pampas grass, its穂 heavy in the autumn wind" is more concise.
*   **"ancient face of nature has faded" vs. "太古時代那原始的自然風貌，不知在何時已經悄然褪色"**: The English is acceptable, but "pristine nature has faded" is closer to the original meaning.
*   **"religious sentiment" vs. "宗教的感念"**: "Religious conviction" or "spiritual beliefs" might be stronger and more accurate.
*   **"ugliness of the defeated" vs. "失敗的醜態"**: The English is accurate, but "shame of defeat" might be more impactful.
*   **"perishing weak" vs. "弱者"**: "Vanquished weak" is closer to the original meaning.
*   **"clumsy prose" vs. "拙ない筆"**: "Humble words" or "simple writing" might be more appropriate, reflecting the author's modesty.

I have incorporated these suggestions into the updated translation below.
