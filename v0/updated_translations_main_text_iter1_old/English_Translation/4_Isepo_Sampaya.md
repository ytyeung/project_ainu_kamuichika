兎が自ら歌った謡「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら兄様のあとをしたって山へ行きました.
毎日毎日兄様のあとへ行って見ると
人間が弩いしゆみを仕掛けて置いてあるとその弩を兄様が
こわしてしまう,それを私は笑うのを
常としていたのでこの日また
行って見たら,ちっとも
思いがけない
兄様が弩にかかって泣き叫んでいる.
私はビックリして,兄様のそばへ
飛んで行ったら兄様は
泣きながら云うことには,
「これ弟よ,今これから
お前は走って行って
私たちの村の後へ着いたら
兄様が弩にかかったよ――,フオホホーイと
大声でよぶのだよ.」
私はきいて
ハイ,ハイ,と返辞をして,それから
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら来て
私たちの村の村後へ着きました.
そこではじめて兄様が私を使いによこしたことを
思い出しました,私は大声で叫び声を挙げようとした
が,兄様が何を言って私を使によこしてあったのか
すっかり私は忘れていました.そこに立ちつくして
思い出そうとしたがどうしてもだめだ.
それからまた
二つの谷を越え三つの谷を越え
後へ逆飛び逆躍びしながら
兄様のいる所へ来て
見ると誰もいない.
兄様の血だけがそこらに附いていた.
(ここまでで話は外へ飛ぶ)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
毎日毎日私は山へ行って
人間が弩を仕掛けてあるのをこわして
それを面白がるのが常であった所が
ある日また,前の所に弩が仕掛けて
あると,その側に小さい蓬よもぎの弩が
仕掛けてある,
私はそれを見ると
「こんな物,何にする物だろう.」
と思っておかしいので
ちょとそれに触って見た,直ぐに逃げようと
したら,思いがけ
なく,その弩にいやという程
はまってしまった.
逃げようともがけば
もがくほど,強くしめられるのでどうする事も
出来ないので,私は泣いて
いると,私の側へ何だか
飛んで来たので見るとそれは私の弟
であった.私はよろこんで,私たちの一族のものに
この事を知らせる様に言いつけてやったが
それからいくら待っても何の音もない.
私は泣いていると,私の側へ
人の影があらわれた.見ると,
神の様な美しい人間の若者
ニコニコして,私を取って,
どこかへ持って行った.見ると
大きな家の中が神の宝物で
一ぱいになっている.
彼かの若者は火を焚いて,
大きな鍋を火にかけて,掛けてある刀を引き抜いて
私のからだを皮のままブツブツに切って
鍋一ぱいに入れそれから鍋の下へ頭を突き入れ突き入れ
火を焚きつけ出した.どうかして
逃げたいので私は人間の若者の隙を
ねらうけれども,人間の若者はちっとも私から
眼をはなさない.
「鍋が煮え立って私が煮えてしまったら,なんにも
ならないつまらない死方,悪い死方をしなければならない.」と
思って人間の若者の油断を
ねらってねらって,やっとの事
一片の肉に自分を化かわらして
立ち上る湯気に身を交まじえて鍋の椽に
上り,左の座へ飛び下りると直ぐに
戸外へ飛び出した,泣きながら
飛んで息を切らして逃げて来て
私の家へ着いて
ほんとうにあぶないことであったと胸撫で下した.
後ふりかえって見ると,
ただの人間,ただの若者とばかり
思っていたのはオキキリムイ,神の様な強い方
なのでありました.
ただの人間が仕掛けた弩だと思って
毎日毎日悪戯をしたのをオキキリムイ
は大そう怒って蓬の小弩で
私を殺そうとしたのだが,私も
ただの身分の軽い神でもないのに,つまらない死方,悪い死方
をしたら,私の親類のもの共も,困り惑うであろう
事を不憫に思って下されて
おかげで,私が逃げても追いかけなかった
のでありました.
それから,前には,兎は
鹿ほども体の大きなものであったが,
この様な悪戯を私がしたために
オキキリムイの一つの肉片ほど小さくなったのです.
これからの私たちの仲間はみんなこの位の
からだになるのであろう.
これからの兎たちよ,決していたずらをしなさるな.
と,兎の首領が子供等を教えて死にました.

兔子親自吟唱的歌謠「桑帕亞 特雷克」

桑帕亞 特雷克
躍過兩道山谷，再越三道山谷，
我一路嬉戲，追隨兄長前往山林。
每日，我總跟在兄長身後，眼見
人類設下弩弓陷阱。兄長便將弩弓
破壞殆盡，而我總在一旁嘲笑。
日復一日，習以為常，這天我又
前去，卻萬萬
沒想到，
兄長竟被弩弓射中，痛苦哀嚎。
我驚駭萬分，飛奔至兄長身旁。
兄長哭泣著說道：
「弟弟啊，你快
跑回
我們的村落邊緣，
大聲呼喊——『兄長被弩弓射中了！呼喔呼喔伊！』」
我聽罷，
應聲道：「好，好。」隨即
躍過兩道山谷，再越三道山谷，
一路嬉戲，抵達
我們的村落邊緣。
在那裡，我才猛然想起兄長差遣我前來的目的。
我正要放聲呼喊，
卻全然忘記兄長要我說些什麼。
我愣在原地，
竭力回想，卻怎麼也想不起來。
於是，我又
躍過兩道山谷，再越三道山谷，
一路倒退跳躍，
回到兄長所在之處，
卻已空無一人。
只留下斑斑血跡。

（故事至此，峰迴路轉）

凱托卡 沃伊沃伊 凱托卡，凱托卡 沃伊 凱托卡
每日，我依舊前往山林，
破壞人類設下的弩弓陷阱，
並以此為樂。
某日，我來到往常之地，發現那裡設有弩弓，
而在其旁，竟設有一張小小的艾草弩弓。
我見狀，
心想：「這玩意兒，有何用處？」
覺得十分可笑，
便輕輕碰觸了一下，正欲逃離，
卻出乎意料地，
被那弩弓牢牢地
夾住了。
越是掙扎，想要逃脫，
便夾得越緊，束手無策。
我哭喊著，
此時，有什麼東西
飛到我身邊，定睛一看，竟是我的弟弟。
我欣喜若狂，囑咐他將此事告知族人，
但等候許久，卻杳無音訊。
我哭泣著，這時，
出現了一個身影。仔細一看，
是一位宛如神祇般俊美的人類青年，
笑盈盈地，抓住我，
帶往某處。只見
一間巨大的屋子裡，堆滿了神聖的寶物。
那位青年點燃了火，
將一口大鍋架在火焰之上，拔出懸掛的刀刃，
將我的身體連皮帶肉剁成碎塊，
填滿整個鍋子，然後將頭探入鍋底，
開始煽風點火。我一心想要
逃脫，便伺機尋找人類青年的破綻，
但他卻寸步不離地盯著我。
「若鍋子沸騰，我便被煮熟，那樣的死法毫無意義，死得太難看了！」
我如此想著，伺機尋找人類青年的疏忽，
好不容易，
將自己化為一片肉片，
混入升騰的蒸汽之中，攀爬至鍋子的邊緣，
縱身跳到左側，立刻
衝出屋外，一邊哭泣，一邊
氣喘吁吁地逃回家中，
慶幸自己死裡逃生。
回首望去，
原本以為只是一介凡人，一個年輕人，
沒想到竟是奧基基里穆伊，一位強大如神祇的存在。
我以為只是人類設下的弩弓，
每日惡作劇，奧基基里穆伊
對此震怒不已，想用艾草小弩弓
殺死我，但我
也並非只是無名小神，若我死得毫無價值，死得如此難堪，
我的親族們定會困惑不已。
他憐憫我，
因此，我逃離時，他並未追趕。

在那之前，兔子
有如鹿一般巨大，
只因我犯下這等惡作劇，
奧基基里穆伊便將我變得如他的一片肉般渺小。
從今往後，我們的同伴都將變得如此弱小。
往後的兔子們啊，切記不可再惡作劇了。
兔子首領如此教誨著孩子們，然後逝去。

This is the English translation.
This is the song of the rabbit, called "Sanpaya Tereke":

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys, across three valleys I hopped,
Following my elder brother, playing as I went, to the mountains.
Every day I followed my brother, and I saw
Humans had set a crossbow trap. My brother
Would break the trap, and I would laugh.
This was my habit, so on this day, again
I went, and unexpectedly,
My brother was caught in the trap, crying out in pain.
I was shocked, and flew to my brother's side.
He said to me, weeping,
"Listen, little brother, you must run now
Back to our village, and when you reach the edge,
Shout out, 'Brother is caught in a trap! Hoo-ho-hoi!'"
I listened, and replied,
"Yes, yes," and then,
Across two valleys, across three valleys I hopped,
Playing as I went, until
I reached the edge of our village.
There, I finally remembered why my brother had sent me.
I tried to shout out the message,
But I had completely forgotten what my brother had told me to say.
I stood there, trying to remember, but I couldn't.
So then, again,
Across two valleys, across three valleys,
Backwards I hopped and skipped,
Back to where my brother was.
But he was gone.
Only his blood remained.

(Here the story takes a turn)

Ketoka, woioi ketoka, ketoka, woi ketoka.
Every day I went to the mountains,
Breaking the crossbow traps set by humans,
And enjoying the mischief.
But one day, at the usual place, there was a trap,
And beside it, a small mugwort crossbow.
When I saw it, I thought,
"What is this thing for?"
And because it seemed funny,
I touched it. I tried to run away,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in the trap, tighter than I could bear.
The more I struggled to escape,
The tighter it squeezed, and I could do nothing.
I was crying,
When something flew to my side.
It was my younger brother. I was happy, and told him
To tell our family what had happened.
But no sound came.
As I wept, a shadow
Appeared beside me. It was
A beautiful young man, like a god.
Smiling, he took me
And carried me away. I saw
A large house filled with divine treasures.
The young man lit a fire,
Put a large pot over the flames, drew a sword,
And cut my body, skin and all, into pieces,
Filling the pot. Then he put his head under the pot,
Stoking the fire. I wanted to escape,
So I watched for an opening.
But the young man never took his eyes off me.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked, I will die
A meaningless, terrible death," I thought.
I watched and waited for the young man to let his guard down.
Finally, I transformed myself into a single piece of meat,
Mixed myself with the rising steam, climbed to the edge of the pot,
Jumped to the left side, and immediately
Leapt out the door. Crying,
I flew, breathless,
Back to my home,
Relieved that I had escaped such danger.
Looking back,
I realized that the man, the young man,
Was not just a human, but Okikirmui, a god of great power.
Okikirmui was very angry that I had played pranks
On the traps set by humans, so he tried to kill me
With the small mugwort crossbow. But I, too,
Am not just a god of low status. If I had died a meaningless, terrible death,
My relatives would have been troubled and confused.
He took pity on me,
And that is why he did not chase me when I escaped.
Before this, rabbits
Were as large as deer.
But because of the mischief I caused,
Okikirmui made me as small as one of his pieces of meat.
From now on, all of our kind will be this size.
From now on, rabbits, never play pranks.
And with these words, the rabbit chief taught his children and died.

This is the song the rabbit himself sang, "Sanpaya Tereke":

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys, then across three valleys I hopped,
Playing as I went, following my elder brother to the mountains.
Every day, day after day, I followed my brother, and I saw
Humans had set crossbow traps. My brother
Would break each trap, and I would laugh at him.
This was my habit, day in, day out, so on this day, once again,
I went, and unexpectedly,
My brother was caught in a trap, crying out in pain!
I was shocked, and flew to my brother's side.
Weeping, he said to me,
"Listen, little brother, run quickly now
Back to the edge of our village,
And shout loudly, 'Brother is caught in a trap! Hoo-ho-hoi!'"
I listened, and replied,
"Yes, yes," and then,
Across two valleys, then across three valleys I hopped,
Playing as I went, until
I reached the edge of our village.
There, I finally remembered why my brother had sent me on this errand.
I tried to shout out the message,
But I had completely forgotten what my brother had told me to say!
I stood there, frozen, trying to remember, but I couldn't, no matter what.
So then, again,
Across two valleys, then across three valleys,
Backwards I hopped and skipped,
Back to where my brother was.
But he was gone, not a soul in sight.
Only his blood remained, splattered everywhere.

(Here the story takes a turn)

Ketoka, woioi ketoka, ketoka, woi ketoka.
Every day, day after day, I went to the mountains,
Breaking the crossbow traps set by humans,
And enjoying the mischief, finding it amusing.
But one day, at the usual place, there was a trap,
And beside it, a small mugwort crossbow.
When I saw it, I thought,
"What could this thing possibly be for?"
And because it seemed so funny,
I touched it lightly. I tried to run away,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in the trap, tighter than I could bear!
The more I struggled to escape,
The tighter it squeezed, and I could do nothing at all.
I was crying,
When something flew to my side.
It was my younger brother. I was overjoyed, and told him
To tell our family what had happened.
But after waiting and waiting, no sound came.
As I wept, a shadow
Appeared beside me. It was
A beautiful young man, like a god.
Smiling, he seized me
And carried me away. I saw
A large house filled with divine treasures, piled high.
The young man lit a fire,
Put a large pot over the flames, drew a sword,
And cut my body, skin and all, into pieces,
Filling the pot to the brim. Then he put his head under the pot,
Stoking the fire with all his might. I wanted to escape, desperately,
So I watched for an opening, a chance.
But the young man never took his eyes off me, not for a moment.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked, I will die
A meaningless, terrible death!" I thought.
I watched and waited, searching for the slightest lapse in the young man's guard.
Finally, with great effort, I transformed myself into a single piece of meat,
Mixed myself with the rising steam, climbed to the edge of the pot,
Jumped to the left side, and immediately
Leapt out the door. Crying,
I flew, breathless,
Back to my home,
Relieved that I had escaped such mortal danger.
Looking back,
I realized that the man, the young man I thought was just a human,
Was none other than Okikirmui, a god of immense power.
Okikirmui was furious that I had played pranks
On the traps set by humans, so he tried to kill me
With the small mugwort crossbow. But I, too,
Am not just a god of low status. If I had died a meaningless, terrible death,
My relatives would have been troubled and confused beyond measure.
He took pity on me,
And that is why he did not chase me when I escaped.
Before this, rabbits
Were as large as deer.
But because of the mischief I caused,
Okikirmui made me as small as one of his pieces of meat.
From now on, all of our kind will be this size.
From now on, rabbits, never, ever play pranks!
And with these words, the rabbit chief taught his children and died.

The English translation is generally good but misses some nuances and stylistic choices present in the Japanese and captured well in the Chinese translation. Specifically:

1.  **Emphasis and Repetition:** The English translation flattens some of the repetition used for emphasis in the original Japanese. The Chinese translation often retains these repetitions, adding to the chant-like quality.
2.  **Specificity:** The Chinese translation is sometimes more specific, which is helpful for clarity. For example, specifying "village edge" instead of just "village".
3.  **Cultural Context:** The Chinese translation uses phrasing that better reflects the cultural context of storytelling and folklore.
4.  **Flow and Rhythm:** The Chinese translation sometimes has a better flow and rhythm, making it more engaging to read.

Based on these observations, I will improve the English translation by:

*   Retaining more of the original repetitions for emphasis.
*   Incorporating specific details from the Chinese translation where they enhance clarity.
*   Adjusting phrasing to improve the flow and rhythm of the text.
*   Maintaining the original meaning and tone of the Japanese text.
