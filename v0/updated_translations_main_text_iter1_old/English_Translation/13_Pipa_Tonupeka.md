沼貝が自ら歌った謡「トヌペカ ランラン」

トヌペカ ランラン
強烈な日光に私の居る所も
乾いてしまって今にも私は死にそうです.
「誰か,水を飲ませて下すって
助けて下さればいい.水よ水よ」と私たちが泣き叫んで
いますと,ずーっと浜の方から一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.
私たちは泣いていますと,私たちの傍を通り
私たちを見ると,
「おかしな沼貝,悪い沼貝,何を泣いて
うるさい事さわいでいるのだろう.」と言って
私たちを踏みつけ,足先にかけ飛ばし,貝殻と共につぶして
ずーっと山へ行ってしまいました.
「おお痛,苦しい,水よ水よ.」と泣き叫んで
いると,ずっと浜の方からまた一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.私たちは
「誰か私たちに水を飲ませて助けて下さるといい,
おお痛,おお苦しい,水よ水よ.」と叫び泣きました
すると,娘さんは,神の様な美しい気高い様子で
私の側へ来て私たちを見ると,
「まあかわいそうに,大へん暑くて沼貝たちの
寝床も乾いてしまって水を欲しがって
いるのだね,どうしたのでしょう
何だか踏みつけられでもした様だが......」と言いつつ
私たちみんなを拾い集めて蕗の葉に
入れて,きれいな湖に入れてくれました.
清い冷水でスッカリ元気を恢復し
大へん丈夫になりました.そこで始めて
かの女たちの気性を探って
見ると,先に来て,私を踏みつぶした
にくらしい女,わるい女はサマユンクルの
妹で,私たちを憫み
助けて下さった若い娘さん淑しとやかな方
は,オキキリムイの妹なのでありました.
サマユンクルの妹は悪にくらしいので
その粟畑を枯らしてしまい,オキキリムイの
妹のその粟畑をばよく実らせました.
その年に,オキキリムイの妹は大そう多く収穫をしました.
私の故為せいでそうなった事を知って
沼貝の殻で粟の穂を摘みました.
それから,毎年,人間の女たちは
栗の穂を摘む時は沼貝の殻を使う様になったのです.
と,一つの沼貝が物語りました.

沼貝親自唱的歌謠「托努佩卡 蘭蘭」

托努佩卡 蘭蘭...

毒辣的太陽曬得我待的地方都
乾巴巴的，感覺快要死掉了。

「有沒有人啊，給我們一點水喝！
救救我們吧！水啊水啊！」我們這樣哭喊著。

然後，從海邊那邊，走來一個女人，
背著竹簍。我們哭哭啼啼的，她從我們旁邊經過，
看到我們，就說：「奇怪的沼貝，討厭的沼貝！哭什麼哭啊，
吵死了！」

說完，就踩我們，用腳尖踢我們，把我們連殼一起踩碎，
然後就自顧自地往山裡去了。

「好痛！好難受！水啊水啊！」我們繼續哭喊著。

接著，又從海邊那邊，走來另一個女人，
背著竹簍。我們趕緊喊：「有沒有人能給我們水喝，救救我們啊！
好痛！好難受！水啊水啊！」

這時，那位姑娘，長得像神仙一樣漂亮又高貴，
走到我們旁邊。她看到我們，就說：「哎呀，真可憐！這麼熱的天，沼貝們
住的地方都乾了，一定很想喝水吧。
這是怎麼搞的？
好像被人踩過一樣……」

她一邊說，一邊把我們一個個撿起來，
放在蕗葉上，再把我們放進清澈的湖水裡。

喝了乾淨又冰涼的湖水，我們立刻恢復了精神，
變得非常健康。這時候，我們才開始
打聽這些女人的底細。

結果發現，先來，還踩我們的
那個可惡的女人，是薩瑪雲庫爾的妹妹。而可憐我們，
幫助我們的年輕姑娘，是溫柔善良的
奧基基里穆伊的妹妹。

薩瑪雲庫爾的妹妹因為心腸壞，
害得她的粟米田都枯萎了。而奧基基里穆伊的
妹妹的粟米田，卻結滿了果實。

那一年，奧基基里穆伊的妹妹大豐收。
她知道這是因為我們的關係，
就用沼貝殼來摘粟米的穗。

從那之後，每年，人類的女人們
在摘粟米穗的時候，都會用沼貝殼。

一隻沼貝這樣說著。

This is the English translation.
This is the song of the marsh clam, "Tonupeka Ranran," sung by myself.

Tonupeka Ranran...

The fierce sun beats down, and the place where I dwell is dried up. I feel as though I am about to die.

"Oh, someone, please give us water to drink! Please help us! Water, water!" we cried out.

Then, from the direction of the beach, a woman came carrying a basket on her back. As we cried, she passed by us. When she saw us, she said, "You strange marsh clams, you wretched marsh clams! What are you crying about, making such a racket?"

And with that, she trampled upon us, kicked us away with her toes, crushing us with our shells. Then, she went off towards the mountains.

"Oh, it hurts! It's painful! Water, water!" we cried out.

Then, from the direction of the beach, another woman came carrying a basket on her back. We cried out, "Oh, someone, please give us water to drink and help us! Oh, it hurts! Oh, it's painful! Water, water!"

Then, the young woman, with a divine and beautiful air of nobility, came to my side. When she saw us, she said, "Oh, you poor things! It's so hot, and the marsh clams' beds have dried up. They must be longing for water. What happened? It looks like you've been trampled..."

And with that, she gathered us all up, placed us on a butterbur leaf, and put us in a beautiful lake.

In the pure, cold water, we completely regained our strength and became very healthy. It was then that I began to investigate the nature of these women.

The hateful woman who came first and trampled upon me was the younger sister of Samayunkuru. The kind young woman who pitied us and helped us was the younger sister of Okikirmui.

Because the younger sister of Samayunkuru was wicked and hateful, she caused her millet field to wither. But the younger sister of Okikirmui caused her millet field to bear much fruit.

That year, the younger sister of Okikirmui had a great harvest. Knowing that this was because of me, she used marsh clam shells to harvest the millet ears.

And from then on, every year, when human women harvest millet ears, they use marsh clam shells.

So spoke one of the marsh clams.

This is the song of the marsh clam, "Tonupeka Ranran," sung by myself.

Tonupeka Ranran...

The scorching sun bakes the place where I dwell, dried to a crisp. I feel as though I'm about to die.

"Oh, someone, please give us water to drink! Save us! Water, water!" we cried and wailed.

Then, from the direction of the beach, a woman came carrying a basket on her back. Crying and sniveling, she passed right by us. When she saw us, she said, "You strange marsh clams, you wretched marsh clams! What are you crying about, making such a racket?"

And with that, completely ignoring our plight, she trampled upon us, kicked us away with her toes, crushing us with our shells. Then, self-centeredly, she went off towards the mountains.

"Oh, it hurts! It's agonizing! Water, water!" we cried out.

The English translation is generally good but can be improved by incorporating some of the nuances present in the Japanese and reflected in the Chinese translation. Specifically, the English translation could benefit from a slightly more emotive tone in certain places, and a clearer indication of the women's actions being 'self-centered'.

Comparison:
*   The Chinese translation often uses more descriptive language, adding emotional weight to the narrative. For example, "毒辣的太陽曬得我待的地方都乾巴巴的，感覺快要死掉了" (the fierce sun bakes the place where I dwell until it's dried up, I feel like I'm about to die) is more evocative than the English "The fierce sun beats down, and the place where I dwell is dried up. I feel as though I am about to die."
*   The Chinese translation explicitly states the first woman went to the mountain "自顧自地" (self-centeredly), which is implied but not directly stated in the English.
*   The Chinese translation uses "哭哭啼啼的" (crying and sniveling) to describe the clams' crying, which adds more emotion than the English "As we cried".

Improvements:
*   Incorporate more descriptive language to enhance the emotional impact.
*   Clarify the first woman's self-centeredness.
*   Use more vivid language to describe the clams' distress.
