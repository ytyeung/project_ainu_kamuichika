小狼の神が自ら歌った謡
「ホテナオ」

ホテナオ
ある日に退屈なので浜辺へ出て,
遊んでいたら一人の小男が
来ていたから,川下へ下ると
私も川下へ下り,
川上へ来ると私も川上へ行き道をさえぎった.
すると川下へ六回
川上へ六回になった時小男は
持前の癇癪かんしゃくを顔に表して言うことには,
「ピイピイ
この小僧め悪い小僧め,そんな事をするなら
この岬の,昔の名と今の名を
言い解いて見ろ」
私は聞いて笑いながらいうこと
には,
「誰がこの岬の昔の名と
今の名を知らないものか!
昔は,尊いえらい神様や人間が居ったから
この岬を神の岬と
言ったものだが,今は時代が衰えたから
御幣の岬とよんでいるのさ!」
云うと,小男の云うことには,
「ピイトン,ピイトン
この小僧め本当にお前はそういうなら
この川の前の名と今の名を
云って見ろ.」
聞くと,私の云うことには,
「誰がこの川の前の名
今の名を知らないものか!
昔,えらかった時代にはこの川を
流れの早い川と云っていたのだが
今は世が衰えているので流れの遅い川と
云っているのさ.」
云うと小男の云うことには,
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン
本当にお前そんな事を云うなら
お互の素性の解き合いをやろう.」
聞いて私の云うことには,
「誰がお前の素性を知らないものか!
大昔,オキキリムイが山へ行って
狩猟小舎を建てた時榛はしばみの木の炉縁ろぶちを作ったら
その炉縁が火に当ってからからに乾いてしまった.
オキキリムイが片方を踏むと片一方が
上る,それをオキキリムイが怒って
その炉縁を川へ持って下り
捨ててしまったのだ.
それからその炉縁は流れに沿うて流れていって
海へ出で,彼方かなたの海波,此方こなたの海波
に打ちつけられる様を神様たちが御覧になって,
敬うべきえらいオキキリムイの手作りの物がその様に
何の役にもたたず迷い流れて海水と共に腐ってしまうのは
勿体もったいない事だから神様たちから
その炉縁は魚にされて,
炉縁魚と
名づけられたのだ.
ところがその炉縁魚は,自分の素性が
わからないので,人にばけてうろついている.
その炉縁魚がお前なのさ.」
云うと,小男は顔色を
変え変え聞いていたが
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン!
お前は,小さい,狼の子なの
さ.」
云い終ると直ぐに海へパチャンと飛び込んだ.
あと見送ると一つの赤い魚が
尾鰭おびれを動かしてずーっと沖へ
行ってしまった.
と,幼い狼の神様が物語りました.

小狼神親口唱的歌謠
「霍特瑙」

霍特瑙啊，

有一天，我閒得發慌，就跑到海邊去。正玩得高興，來了一個小不點兒。
我往河下游走，
他就跟著往河下游走。
我往河上游走，他就跟著往河上游走，還擋住我的路。
這樣來來回回，在河下游走了六趟，
又往河上游走了六趟。最後，那小不點兒終於忍不住了，氣呼呼地說：
「嗶嗶！
你這小鬼頭，壞小子！你要是再這樣鬧，
就說說看，這海岬以前叫什麼，現在又叫什麼！」
我聽了，笑嘻嘻地回答：
「誰不知道這海岬以前和
現在的名字啊！
以前，因為住著尊貴又了不起的神明和人，
所以這海岬叫做神之岬。
但現在時代不一樣了，
就叫做御幣之岬啦！」
聽我這麼說，小不點兒說：
「嗶咚，嗶咚！
你這小鬼頭，你要真那麼厲害，
就說說看，這條河以前叫什麼，現在又叫什麼！」
我聽了，回答說：
「誰不知道這條河以前和
現在的名字啊！
以前，在那個了不起的時代，這條河叫做
水流湍急的河。
但現在世道變了，就叫做水流慢吞吞的河啦！」
聽我這麼說，小不點兒說：
「嗶咚咚，嗶咚咚！
你要真那麼厲害，
不如我們來互相揭老底，怎麼樣？」
我聽了，回答說：
「誰不知道你的老底啊！
很久很久以前，奧基基穆伊去山上
蓋狩獵小屋，用榛木做了個爐框，
那爐框被火一烤，就變得乾巴巴的。
奧基基穆伊一踩一邊，另一邊就
翹起來。奧基基穆伊氣得火冒三丈，
就把那爐框拿到河邊
丟掉了。
之後，那爐框就順著水流漂啊漂，
漂到海裡。神明們看到它被遠方的海浪、近方的海浪
拍打的樣子，
覺得可敬又偉大的奧基基穆伊親手做的東西，竟然這樣
毫無用處地漂流，跟海水一起爛掉，
實在太可惜了。所以神明們
就把那爐框變成了一條魚，
叫做爐框魚。
可是那爐框魚啊，因為不知道自己是誰，
就變成人的樣子到處晃蕩。
那條爐框魚，就是你啦！」
聽我這麼說，小不點兒的臉色
變來變去，
「嗶咚咚，嗶咚咚！
你，是小小的一隻，狼崽子
啊！」
話一說完，立刻撲通一聲跳進海裡。
我目送著他，只見一條紅色的魚
擺動著尾巴，一直往遠方
游走了。

小狼神就是這樣說著他的故事。

This is the English translation.
A Chant Sung by the Little Wolf God Himself:
"Hotenao"

Hotenao,

One day, bored, I went down to the beach.
As I was playing, a little man came along.
When I went downstream,
He followed me downstream.
When I went upstream, he followed me upstream, blocking my path.
This happened six times downstream,
And six times upstream. Finally, the little man,
His inherent temper flaring on his face, said,
"Pii-pii!
You little brat, you wicked little brat! If you're going to act like that,
Tell me the old name and the current name of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this cape?
Long ago, because noble and great gods and people lived here,
This cape was called the Cape of the Gods.
But now, because the times have declined,
It is called the Cape of Gohei!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you really know so much,
Tell me the old name and the current name of this river!"
Listening, I replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this river?
In the old days, when times were great, this river
Was called the River of Swift Currents.
But now, because the world has declined, it is called the River of Slow Currents!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you really know so much,
Let's test each other's origins!"
Listening, I replied,
"Who doesn't know your origins?
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
Rose up. Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
Then that hearth frame drifted along the current,
Out to sea, where the waves from afar and the waves from here
Beat upon it. The gods, seeing this,
Thought it a waste that something made by the revered and great Okikirmui
Was pointlessly drifting and rotting away with the seawater.
So the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And named it the Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, not knowing its own origins,
Transforms into a person and wanders about.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you!"
Hearing this, the little man's face
Changed color again and again.
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You are a small, little wolf
Child!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
Watching him go, I saw a single red fish
Moving its tail fin and heading far out to sea.

And so, the young wolf god told his story.

A Chant Sung by the Little Wolf God Himself:
"Hotenao"

Hotenao,

One day, feeling bored, I wandered down to the beach.
While playing around, a little guy showed up.
I went downstream,
He followed downstream.
I went upstream, he followed upstream, blocking my way.
Back and forth, six times downstream,
Six times upstream. Finally, the little guy, his temper flaring, burst out,
"Pii-pii!
You little rascal, you wicked brat! If you keep this up,
tell me, what's this cape called now, and what was it called before?"
I chuckled and replied,
"Who doesn't know this cape's names?
Long ago, because great gods and people lived here,
it was called the Cape of the Gods.
But now, times have changed,
it's called the Cape of Gohei!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you're so smart,
tell me, what's this river called now, and what was it called before?"
I replied,
"Who doesn't know this river's names?
In the good old days, it was called
the River of Swift Currents.
But now, the world's gone downhill, it's called the River of Slow Currents!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you're really so clever,
let's reveal each other's true nature!"
I replied,
"Who doesn't know your true nature?
Long, long ago, Okikirmui went to the mountains
and built a hunting lodge. He made a hearth frame from hazel wood.
But when the fire hit it, it dried right out.
Every time Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other
popped up. Furious, Okikirmui
took the hearth frame to the river
and threw it in.
Then that hearth frame drifted with the current,
out to sea, where the distant waves and the nearby waves
battered it. The gods, seeing this,
thought it a pity that something made by the revered Okikirmui
was drifting uselessly and rotting in the sea.
So the gods
turned that hearth frame into a fish,
called the Hearth Frame Remnant.
But that Hearth Frame Remnant, not knowing who he was,
started wandering around disguised as a person.
That Hearth Frame Remnant is you!"
Hearing this, the little man's face
went pale,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You're just a tiny, little wolf
cub!"
As soon as he said it, he splashed into the sea.
Watching him go, I saw a single red fish
flip its tail and swim far, far away.

And so, the young wolf god told his story.

The English translation is generally accurate but a bit verbose and misses some of the nuances present in the Japanese and captured in the Chinese translation. It could be more concise and capture the playful tone better. The Chinese translation is more lively and captures the rhythm and tone of the original chant more effectively. It also uses more colloquial language, which suits the narrative style.

Specifically:

*   The English translation repeats phrases like "old name and the current name" which, while accurate, sounds clunky. The Chinese translation uses a more natural phrasing.
*   The English translation's description of Okikirmui's hearth frame is a bit too literal. The Chinese translation captures the frustration and absurdity of the situation more effectively.
*   The English translation uses "Hearth Frame Fish" which is a very literal translation. The Chinese translation is more elegant.
*   The English translation is a bit too formal in places. The Chinese translation uses more colloquial language, which is more appropriate for a chant.

I will improve the English translation by:

*   Making it more concise and less repetitive.
*   Using more vivid and engaging language.
*   Incorporating the strengths of the Chinese translation, such as its more natural phrasing and colloquial tone.
*   Improving the flow and rhythm of the text to better reflect the original chant.
