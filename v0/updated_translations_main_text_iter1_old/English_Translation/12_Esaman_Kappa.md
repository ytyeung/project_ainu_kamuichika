獺かわうそが自ら歌った謡
「カッパ レウレウ カッパ」

カッパ レウレウ カッパ
ある日に,流れに沿うて遊びながら
泳いで下りサマユンクルの
水汲路のところに来ると,
サマユンクルの妹が神の様な美しい容子で
片手に手桶を持ち片手に
蒲の束を持って来ているので
川の縁に私は頭だけ出し,
「お父様をお持ちですか?
お母様をお持ちですか?」と云うと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見つけると,怒の色を顔に
現して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと,大きな犬どもが
駈け出して来て,私を見ると牙を鳴ら
している.私はビックリして川の底へ
潜り込んで直ぐそのまま川底を通って
逃げ下った.
そうして,オキキリムイの水汲路の
川口へ頭だけだして
見ると,オキキリムイの妹が
神の様に美しい様子で片手に手桶を持ち
片手に蒲の束を持って
来たので私のいうことには,
「御父様をお持ちですか?
御母様をお持ちですか?」というと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見ると,怒りの色を顔に
表して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと大きな犬どもが駈け出して来た.
それを見て私は先刻の事を思い出し
可笑しく思いながら川の底へ
潜りこんで逃げようとしたら,
まさか犬たちがそんな事をしようとは
思わなかったのに,牙を鳴らしながら
川の底まで私に飛び付き
陸へ私を引き摺り上げ,私の頭も私の体も
噛みつかれ噛みむしられて,しまいに
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気が付いて見ると,
大きな獺の耳と耳の間に私はすわって
いた.
サマユンクルもオキキリムイも
父もなく母もないのを私は知って
あんな悪戯をしたので罰を当てられ
オキキリムイの犬どもに殺され
つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
これからの獺たちよ,決して悪戯をしなさるな.
と,獺が物語った.

水獺自述的悲歌
「河童 咧嗚咧嗚 河童」

河童 咧嗚咧嗚 河童

有一天，我沿著小溪，快活地游啊游，來到了薩瑪雲庫魯取水的地方。我看到薩瑪雲庫魯的妹妹站在那裡，美得像個神仙似的，一手提著水桶，另一手拿著一束香蒲。

我從河邊探出頭，問她：「妳有爸爸嗎？有媽媽嗎？」

那女孩嚇了一跳，睜大眼睛四處張望。當她發現我時，臉上立刻閃過一絲怒氣。

「哎呀，你這可惡的扁頭，壞扁頭，竟敢取笑人！狗兒們，上啊！……」她喊道。

話音未落，幾隻大狗就衝了出來，對著我齜牙咧嘴。我嚇壞了，趕緊潛入河底，一路往下游逃去。

後來，我又在奧基基里穆伊的河邊探出頭。我看到奧基基里穆伊的妹妹站在那裡，也美得像個神仙似的，一手提著水桶，另一手拿著一束香蒲。

我就問她：「妳有爸爸嗎？有媽媽嗎？」

那女孩嚇了一跳，睜大眼睛四處張望。當她發現我時，臉上立刻閃過一絲怒氣。

「哎呀，你這可惡的扁頭，壞扁頭，竟敢取笑人！狗兒們，上啊！……」她喊道。

大狗們立刻衝了出來。我想到之前發生的事，覺得有點好笑，正想潛入河底逃走，

沒想到那些狗竟然也跳進水裡，張牙舞爪地向我撲來！牠們把我拖到岸上，又咬又撕我的頭和身體，最後我就失去了意識。

等我醒來的時候，發現自己正坐在
一隻大水獺的兩隻耳朵中間。

我知道薩瑪雲庫魯和奧基基里穆伊都沒有父母。我因為惡作劇而受到了懲罰，被奧基基里穆伊的狗咬死了，落得一個愚蠢又可悲的下場。

所以，今後的水獺們啊，千萬不要再惡作劇了！

水獺這樣悲嘆著。

**The Otter's Own Lament**
*"Kappa Reu Reu Kappa"*

Kappa Reu Reu Kappa,

One day, as I frolicked along the stream, swimming downstream, I came to the water-drawing place of Samayunkuru. There, Samayunkuru's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I poked my head out of the water's edge and asked, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, startled, looked around with wide eyes. When she spotted me, anger flashed across her face.

"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead, making fun of people! Dogs, here!..." she cried.

At once, large dogs came rushing out, baring their fangs at me. Terrified, I dove to the bottom of the river and fled downstream.

Then, I peeked my head out at the river mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing place. There, Okikirmui's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I asked her, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, startled, looked around with wide eyes. When she spotted me, anger flashed across her face.

"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead, making fun of people! Dogs, here!..." she cried.

Large dogs came rushing out. Remembering what had happened before, I chuckled to myself and tried to dive to the bottom of the river to escape.

But, to my surprise, the dogs leaped into the water, fangs bared, and attacked me! They dragged me ashore, biting and tearing at my head and body until I lost consciousness.

When I finally came to, I found myself sitting between the ears of a large otter.

I knew that neither Samayunkuru nor Okikirmui had fathers or mothers. I was punished for playing such a prank. I was killed by Okikirmui's dogs, meeting a foolish, wretched end.

So, listen well, all you otters to come: never play such pranks!

Thus, the otter lamented.

**The Otter's Own Dirge**
*"Kappa Reu Reu Kappa"* (A traditional chant)

Kappa Reu Reu Kappa,

One day, as I frolicked along the stream, swimming downstream, I came to the water-drawing place of Samayunkuru. There, Samayunkuru's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I poked my head out of the water's edge and asked, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, startled, looked around with wide eyes. A flash of anger crossed her face when she spotted me.

"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead, making fun of people! Dogs, here!..." she cried.

At once, large dogs came rushing out, baring their fangs at me. Terrified, I dove to the bottom of the river and fled downstream.

Then, I peeked my head out at the river mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing place. There, Okikirmui's younger sister stood, beautiful as a goddess, with a pail in one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.

I asked her, "Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

Thus, the otter lamented.

The English translation is generally good but can be improved by incorporating some elements from the Chinese translation to enhance clarity and emotional impact. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Title:** "The Otter's Own Lament" is a decent title, but the Chinese title "水獺自述的悲歌" (Otter's Self-Narrated Dirge/Elegy) carries a stronger sense of sorrow and self-reflection. Consider a title that reflects this.
*   **Kappa Reu Reu Kappa:** The English translation simply repeats this. The Chinese translation retains the original sound. It might be helpful to add a note explaining that this is a chant or song.
*   **Description of the sisters:** Both translations capture the beauty of the sisters. The Chinese translation uses "美得像個神仙似的" (beautiful as a goddess), which is very close to the English. No major changes needed here.
*   **Otter's question:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.
*   **The maiden's reaction:** The English translation captures the anger well. The Chinese translation uses "臉上立刻閃過一絲怒氣" (a flash of anger crossed her face), which is more vivid. Consider incorporating this.
*   **The maiden's curse:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.
*   **The dog attack:** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation uses "對著我齜牙咧嘴" (baring their fangs at me), which is more descriptive. Consider incorporating this.
*   **Otter's escape and second encounter:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.
*   **The final attack:** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation uses "又咬又撕我的頭和身體" (biting and tearing at my head and body), which is more vivid. Consider incorporating this.
*   **The otter's realization:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.
*   **The moral:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation is also accurate. No major changes needed here.
*   **Final line:** The English translation is accurate. The Chinese translation uses "水獺這樣悲嘆著" (the otter lamented thus), which is more impactful. Consider incorporating this.

In summary, the English translation is accurate but could benefit from incorporating some of the more vivid and emotionally resonant phrasing from the Chinese translation, particularly in describing the maiden's reaction, the dog attack, and the final line.
