梟の神の自ら歌った謡
「銀の滴しずく降る降るまわりに」

「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,金の滴
降る降るまわりに.」という歌を私は歌いながら
流に沿って下り,人間の村の上を
通りながら下を眺めると
昔の貧乏人が今お金持になっていて,昔のお金持が
今の貧乏人になっている様です.
海辺に人間の子供たちがおもちゃの小弓に
おもちゃの小矢をもってあそんで居ります.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながら子供等の上を
通りますと,(子供等は)私の下を走りながら
云うことには,
「美しい鳥! 神様の鳥!
さあ,矢を射てあの鳥
神様の鳥を射当てたものは,一ばんさきに取った者は
ほんとうの勇者,ほんとうの強者だぞ.」
云いながら,昔貧乏人で今お金持になってる者の
子供等は,金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえて私を射ますと,金の小矢を
私は下を通したり上を通したりしました.
その中に,子供等の中に
一人の子供がただの(木製の)小弓にただの小矢
を持って仲間にはいっています.私はそれを見ると
貧乏人の子らしく,着物でも
それがわかります.けれどもその眼色を
よく見ると,えらい人の子孫らしく,一人変り
者になって仲間入りをしています.自分もただの小弓に
ただの小矢を番えて私をねらいますと,
昔貧乏人で今お金持の子供等は大笑いをして
云うには,
「あらおかしや貧乏の子
あの鳥,神様の鳥は私たちの
金の小矢でもお取りにならないものを,お前の様な
貧乏な子のただの矢腐れ木の矢を
あの鳥,神様の鳥がよくよく
取るだろうよ.」
と云って,貧しい子を足蹴にしたり
たたいたりします.けれども貧乏な子は
ちっとも構わず私をねらっています.
私はそのさまを見ると,大層不憫に思いました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながらゆっくりと大空に
私は輪をえがいていました.貧乏な子は
片足を遠く立て片足を近くたてて,
下唇をグッと噛みしめて,ねらっていて
ひょうと射放しました.小さい矢は美しく飛んで
私の方へ来ました,それで私は手を
差しのべてその小さい矢を取りました.
クルクルまわりながら私は
風をきって舞い下りました.
すると,彼かの子供たちは走って
砂吹雪をたてながら競争しました.
土の上に私が落ちると一しょに,一等先に
貧乏な子がかけついて私を取りました.
すると,昔貧乏人で今は金持になってる者の
子供たちは後から走って来て
二十も三十も悪口をついて
貧乏な子を押したりたたいたり
「にくらしい子,貧乏人の子
私たちが先にしようとする事を先がけしやがって.」
と云うと,貧乏な子は,私の上に
おおいかぶさって,自分の腹にしっかりと私を押えていました.
もがいてもがいてやっとの事,人の隙から
飛び出しますと,それから,どんどんかけ出しました.
昔は貧乏人で今は金持の子供等が
石や木片を投げつけるけれど
貧乏な子はちっとも構わず
砂吹雪をたてながらかけて来て一軒の小屋の
表へ着きました.子供は
第一の窗から私を入れて,それに
言葉を添え,斯々かくかくのありさまを物語りました.
家の中から老夫婦が
眼の上に手をかざしながらやって来て
見ると,大へんな貧乏人ではあるけれども
紳士らしい淑女らしい品をそなえています,
私を見ると,腰の央なかをギックリ屈めて,ビックリしました.
老人はキチンと帯をしめ直して,
私を拝し
「ふくろうの神様,大神様,
貧しい私たちの粗末な家へ
お出で下さいました事,有難う御座います.
昔は,お金持に自分を数え入れるほどの者で
御座いましたが今はもうこの様に
つまらない貧乏人になりまして,国の神様
大神様をお泊め申すも
畏れ多い事ながら今日はもう
日も暮れましたから,今宵は大神様を
お泊め申し上げ,明日は,ただイナウだけでも
大神様をお送り申し上げましょう.」という事を
申しながら何遍も何遍も礼拝を重ねました.
老婦人は,東の窗の下に
敷物をしいて私をそこへ置きました.
それからみんな寝ると直ぐに高いびきで
寝入ってしまいました.
私は私の体の耳と耳の間に坐って
いましたがやがて,ちょうど,真夜中時分に
起き上りました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌を静かにうたいながら
この家の左の座へ右の座へ
美しい音をたてて飛びました.
私が羽ばたきをすると,私のまわりに
美しい宝物,神の宝物が美しい音をたてて
落ち散りました.
一寸のうちに,この小さい家を,りっぱな宝物
神の宝物で一ぱいにしました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌をうたいながらこの小さい家を
一寸の間にかねの家,大きな家に
作りかえてしまいました,家の中は,りっぱな宝物の積場
を作り,りっぱな着物の美しいのを
早つくりして家の中を飾りつけました.
富豪の家よりももっとりっぱにこの大きな家の
中を飾りつけました.私はそれを終ると
もとのままに私の冑の
耳と耳の間に坐っていました.
家の人たちに夢を見せて
アイヌのニシパが運が悪くて貧乏人になって
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている者たちに
ばかにされたりいじめられたりしてるさまを私が見て
不憫に思ったので,私は身分の卑しいただの神では
ないのだが,人間の家
に泊って,恵んでやったのだという事を
知らせました.
それが済んで少したって夜が明けますと
家の人々が一しょに起きて
目をこすりこすり家の中を見るとみんな
床の上に腰を抜かしてしまいました.老婦人は
声を上げて泣き,老人は
大粒の涙をポロポロこぼして
いましたが,やがて,老人は起き上り
私の処へ来て,二十も三十も礼拝
を重ねて,そして云う事には,
「ただの夢ただの眠りをしたのだと
思ったのに,ほんとうに,こうしていただいた事.
つまらないつまらない,私共の粗末な家に
お出で下さるだけでも有難く存じますものを
国の神様,大神様,私たちの不運な
事を哀れんで下さいまして
お恵みのうちにも最も大きいお恵みをいただき
ました事.」と云う事を泣きながら
申しました.
それから,老人はイナウの木をきり
りっぱなイナウを美しく作って私を飾りました.
老婦人は身仕度をして
小さい子を手伝わせ,薪をとったり
水を汲んだりして,酒を造る仕度をして,一寸の間に
六つの酒樽を上座にならべました.
それから私は火の老女,老女神と
種々な神の話を語り合いました.
二日程たつと,神様の好物ですから
はや,家の中に酒の香が
漂いました.
そこで,あの小さい子に態わざと
古い衣物を着せて,村中の
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々を
招待するため使いに出してやりました.ので
後見送ると,子供は家毎に
入って使いの口上を述べますと
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々は
大笑いをして
「これはふしぎ,貧乏人どもが
どんな酒を造ってどんな
御馳走があってそのため人を招待するのだろう,
行ってどんな事があるか見物して
笑ってやりましょう.」と
言い合いながら大勢打ち連れて
やって来て,ずーっと遠くから,ただ家を見ただけで
驚いてはずかしがり,そのまま帰る者もあります,
家の前まで来て腰を抜かしているのもあります.
すると,家の夫人が外へ出て
人皆の手を取って家へ入れますと,
みんないざり這いよって
顔を上げる者もありません.
すると,家の主人は起き上って
カッコウ鳥の様な美しい声で物を言いました.
斯々かくかくの訳を物語り
「この様に,貧乏人でへだてなく
互に往来も出来なかったのだが
大神様があわれんで下され,何の悪い考えも
私どもは持っていませんのでしたのでこの様に
お恵みをいただきましたのですから
今から村中,私共は一族の者
なんですから,仲善くして
互に往来をしたいという事を皆様に
望む次第であります.」という事を
申し述べると,人々は
何度も何度も手をすりあわせて
家の主人に罪を謝し,これからは
仲よくする事を話し合いました.
私もみんなに拝されました.
それが済むと,人はみな,心が柔らいで
盛んな酒宴を開きました.
私は,火の神様や家の神様や
御幣ごへい棚の神様と話し合いながら
人間たちの舞を舞ったり躍りをしたりするさまを
眺めて深く興がりました.そして
二日三日たつと酒宴は終りました.
人間たちが仲の善いありさまを
見て,私は安心をして
火の神,家の神
御幣棚の神に別れを告げました.
それが済むと私は自分の家へ帰りました.
私の来る前に,私の家は美しい御幣
美酒が一ぱいになっていました.
それで近い神,遠い神に
使者をたてて招待し,盛んな酒宴を
張りました,席上,神様たちへ
私は物語り,人間の村を訪問した時の
その村の状況,その出来事を詳しく話しますと
神様たちは大そう私をほめたてました.
神様たちが帰る時に美しい御幣を
二つやり三つやりしました.
彼かのアイヌ村の方を見ると,
今はもう平穏で,人間たちは
みんな仲よく,彼のニシパが
村に頭になっています,
彼の子供は,今はもう,成人
して,妻ももち子も持って
父や母に孝行をしています,
何時でも何時でも,酒を造った時は
酒宴のはじめに,御幣やお酒を私に送ってよこします.
私も人間たちの後に坐して
何時でも
人間の国を守護まもっています.
と,ふくろうの神様が物語りました.

This is the Chinese translation.
貓頭鷹神親自吟唱的歌謠
「銀之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方」
「金之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方」

我吟唱著這首歌謠，沿著河流緩緩降下，途經人類的村莊。俯瞰而視，昔日窮困之人，今已富甲一方；往日豪門望族，如今卻家徒四壁。

海邊，稚童們正以玩具弓箭嬉戲。

「銀之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方
金之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方」

我歌聲繚繞，掠過孩子們的頭頂，他們在我身下追逐，高聲呼喊：

「美麗的鳥兒！是神明的使者！
快，射下牠！
誰能射中這神鳥，先搶到者，便是真正的勇者，無可匹敵的強者！」

昔日貧困，今日富有的孩子們，紛紛搭起金弓，以金箭瞄準我。我讓那些金箭，或從身下掠過，或自頭頂飛過。

孩子們之中，唯有一人，手持簡樸的木弓木箭，加入其中。我一眼便看出，他衣衫襤褸，是貧苦人家的孩子。然而，細看他的眼神，卻隱約透露著貴族後裔的氣度，如同孤狼般，卓爾不群。
他也搭起木弓，以木箭瞄準我。

那些昔日貧困，今日富有的孩子們，見狀便放聲嘲笑：

「真是可笑，窮人家的孩子！
那神鳥連我們的金箭都不屑一顧，又怎會理睬你那腐朽的木箭？」

說罷，便對那貧苦的孩子拳打腳踢。但他毫不在意，依舊專注地瞄準著我。

我見此情景，頓生憐憫。

「銀之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方，
金之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方。」

我吟唱著歌謠，緩緩地在廣闊的天空中盤旋。那貧苦的孩子，一腳前，一腳後，緊咬下唇，屏氣凝神，猛然放箭。小箭劃破長空，美麗地飛向我，我伸出手，輕輕接住了它。

我旋轉，飛舞，劃破風的阻力，緩緩降落。

孩子們頓時奔跑起來，揚起漫天沙塵，爭先恐後。
我落地的瞬間，那貧苦的孩子搶先一步，抓住了我。

隨後趕到的，是那些昔日貧困，今日富有的孩子們，他們惡語相向，推搡，毆打那貧苦的孩子：

「可恨的傢伙，窮鬼！竟敢搶奪我們想要的東西！」

那貧苦的孩子，緊緊地將我護在身下，用自己的身體牢牢壓住我。

他奮力掙扎，好不容易從人群的縫隙中脫身，拔腿就跑。

那些昔日貧困，今日富有的孩子們，撿起石塊和木片，朝他扔去，但他全然不顧，任憑沙塵撲面，徑直跑到一間簡陋的小屋前。孩子將我從第一個窗戶塞進屋內，並用言語，將事情的來龍去脈，娓娓道來。

屋內，一對老夫婦用手遮擋著陽光，走了出來。他們衣衫破舊，極其貧寒，但舉手投足間，卻流露出紳士淑女的優雅。
見到我，他們深深地彎下腰，顯得既驚訝又惶恐。

老人整理了一下腰帶，向我鞠躬行禮，說道：

「貓頭鷹神，偉大的神明啊，感謝您降臨到我們這簡陋的家。我們曾也算得上是富裕人家，如今卻淪落至此，一貧如洗。讓您，這國家的神明，偉大的神明，在此留宿，實在是惶恐不安。但今日天色已晚，就請您在此歇息一晚。明日，即使只有小小的祭祀木幣，我們也一定恭送您離開。」

說著，老人一遍又一遍地鞠躬。

老婦人在東窗下鋪好墊子，小心翼翼地將我安放在那裡。

隨後，大家都進入夢鄉，鼾聲如雷。

我端坐在自己的頭盔雙耳之間，在午夜時分，悄然醒來。

「銀之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方，
金之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方。」

我輕聲吟唱著歌謠，在這間小屋的左右兩側，發出美妙的聲音，輕盈地飛翔。

我扇動翅膀，美麗的寶藏，神聖的寶物，伴隨著悅耳的聲響，如雨般散落。

頃刻之間，這間簡陋的小屋，便堆滿了華麗的寶物，神聖的珍藏。

「銀之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方，
金之滴 簌簌落下，灑滿四方。」

我吟唱著歌謠，轉瞬間，將這間小屋，變成了一座金碧輝煌的豪宅，寬敞明亮。屋內，堆滿了無數珍寶，還快速地製作出華麗精美的服飾，用以裝點房屋。

我將這座豪宅裝飾得比富豪的家還要奢華。完成這一切後，我恢復原狀，回到頭盔雙耳之間。

我在夢中向這家人顯靈，讓他們知曉，是阿伊努貴族尼西帕，時運不濟，淪為貧困，被那些昔日貧困，今日富裕之人嘲笑欺凌。我心生憐憫，因此，我，並非尋常神明，而是降臨到他們的人間居所，賜予他們恩惠。

做完這些，不久天亮了，一家人醒來，揉著惺忪的睡眼，環顧四周，頓時驚呆了，癱坐在地上。老婦人失聲痛哭，老人的眼眶也盈滿了淚水。

隨後，老人起身，走到我面前，恭恭敬敬地行了二三十個大禮，哽咽著說道：

「我們還以為這只是一場夢，一場幻覺，沒想到，這一切竟然都是真的！您能光臨我們這簡陋的家，就已經是天大的恩賜了，沒想到您，這國家的神明，偉大的神明，竟然還憐憫我們的不幸，賜予我們如此厚重的恩惠！」

說著，老人泣不成聲。

隨後，老人砍下伊瑙木，精心製作出華麗的祭祀木幣，用以裝飾我。

老婦人也梳妝打扮一番，讓小孩子幫忙撿柴、汲水，準備釀酒。轉眼間，六個酒桶便整齊地擺放在了上座。

接著，我和火之老嫗、老女神，以及其他神明，談論著各種神話故事。

過了兩天左右，屋內便瀰漫著濃郁的酒香，因為這是神明們最喜愛的味道。

於是，他們特意讓那小孩子穿上破舊的衣裳，派他去邀請村裡那些昔日貧困，今日富裕的人們。

目送孩子離開後，他挨家挨戶地說明來意。那些昔日貧困，今日富裕的人們，聽後都捧腹大笑：

「真是稀奇，這些窮鬼能釀出什麼好酒，準備什麼佳餚，竟然還敢邀請我們？走，去看看，讓咱們好好嘲笑他們一番！」

他們三五成群地前來，遠遠地望見那座豪宅，便驚訝不已，羞愧難當，有些人甚至直接轉身離去。
有些人走到門前，卻被嚇得癱倒在地。

這時，屋子的女主人走出來，親切地拉起每個人的手，將他們迎進屋內。大家都跪在地上，不敢抬頭。

屋子的主人起身，用如杜鵑鳥般清脆悅耳的聲音，娓娓道來事情的經過：

「過去，我們因為貧困，無法與大家自由往來。如今，偉大的神明憐憫我們，我們並無任何惡意，因此才得到如此恩賜。從今往後，我們全村人都是一家人，希望大家能夠和睦相處，互通有無。」

聽完這番話，人們紛紛搓著雙手，向屋子的主人賠禮道歉，並商議著從此以後，要和睦相處。

我也接受了大家的敬拜。

一切結束後，人們的心情都變得輕鬆愉快，於是舉辦了一場盛大的酒宴。

我和火神、家神、以及御幣棚的神明們，一邊聊天，一邊欣賞著人們載歌載舞，其樂融融的景象，感到十分欣慰。兩三天後，酒宴終於落下了帷幕。

看到人們和睦相處，我感到十分安心，便向火神、家神、以及御幣棚的神明們告別。

隨後，我回到了自己的家。

在我回來之前，我的家已經擺滿了精美的御幣和醇香的美酒。

於是，我派遣使者，邀請遠近的神明前來赴宴。在宴席上，我詳細地向眾神講述了拜訪人類村莊時的所見所聞，以及發生的種種事情。眾神都對我讚賞有加。

眾神離去時，我贈予他們精美的御幣，有的兩個，有的三個。

我遙望那個阿伊努村莊，如今已恢復了往日的寧靜，人們和睦相處，而那位尼西帕，也成為了村莊的首領。

他的孩子，如今也已長大成人，娶妻生子，孝順父母。

無論何時何地，只要釀了新酒，他們總會在宴會開始之時，將御幣和美酒送給我。

我也默默地守護在人類的身後，永遠守護著人類的國度。

貓頭鷹神這樣講述著他的故事。

This is the English translation.
This is the song of the Owl God, sung by himself:

"Silver drops fall, fall all around,
Golden drops fall, fall all around."

Singing this song, I descended along the river, passing over a human village. Looking down, I saw that the poor of old had become rich, and the rich of old had become poor.

By the seaside, human children were playing with toy bows and arrows.

"Silver drops fall, fall all around,
Golden drops fall, fall all around."

As I passed over the children, they ran beneath me, shouting,

"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Come, shoot it with arrows!
Whoever shoots down that bird, that god's bird, and takes it first, is a true hero, a true strong one!"

The children of those who were once poor but now rich nocked golden arrows to golden bows and shot at me. I let the golden arrows pass above and below me.

Among the children, one held only a simple wooden bow and arrow, joining the others. I could tell he was the child of a poor man by his clothes. But looking closely at his eyes, I saw the bearing of a noble descendant, a lone wolf among the group. He, too, nocked his simple arrow to his simple bow and aimed at me.

The children of those who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,

"How funny, the poor man's child!
That bird, that god's bird, wouldn't even take notice of our golden arrows. Why would it ever take notice of your rotten wooden arrow, you poor child?"

They kicked and hit the poor child. But he paid them no mind, continuing to aim at me.

Seeing this, I felt great pity for him.

"Silver drops fall, fall all around,
Golden drops fall, fall all around."

Singing this song, I slowly circled in the vast sky. The poor child stood with one foot far back and one foot close, biting his lower lip, and released his arrow. The small arrow flew beautifully towards me, and I reached out my hand and caught it.

Spinning and twirling, I cut through the wind and descended.

The children ran, kicking up a sandstorm as they raced. As I landed on the ground, the poor child was the first to reach me and take hold of me.

Then, the children of those who were once poor but now rich ran up, hurling insults by the score, pushing and hitting the poor child.

"Hateful child, poor man's child! You dared to take what we were going to take!"

The poor child covered me with his body, holding me tightly against his stomach.

Struggling and wriggling, he finally broke free from the crowd and ran as fast as he could.

The children of those who were once poor but now rich threw stones and pieces of wood at him, but the poor child paid them no mind, running through the sandstorm until he reached the front of a small hut. The child slipped me through the first window, adding words to me, telling the story of what had happened.

From inside the house, an old couple came out, shading their eyes with their hands. They were terribly poor, but possessed the grace of a gentleman and a lady. When they saw me, they bowed deeply at the waist, startled.

The old man straightened his belt and bowed to me, saying,

"Owl God, Great God, thank you for coming to our humble home. We were once wealthy enough to count ourselves among the rich, but now we are mere paupers. It is presumptuous to offer lodging to the god of the land, the Great God, but as the day is already done, we will offer you lodging for tonight. Tomorrow, we will send you off with only inau."

He repeated his bows many times.

The old woman laid a mat beneath the east window and placed me there.

Soon, everyone went to sleep, snoring loudly.

I sat between the ears on my head, and then, right around midnight, I awoke.

"Silver drops fall, fall all around,
Golden drops fall, fall all around."

Singing this song softly, I flew with a beautiful sound from the left side of the house to the right.

As I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, divine treasures, fell and scattered around me with a beautiful sound.

In an instant, I filled the small house with magnificent treasures, divine treasures.

"Silver drops fall, fall all around,
Golden drops fall, fall all around."

Singing this song, I transformed the small house into a house of gold, a grand house, in an instant. I created a storehouse of magnificent treasures inside, and quickly fashioned beautiful, splendid clothes to decorate the house.

I decorated the inside of this grand house even more splendidly than a wealthy man's home. When I was finished, I returned to my place between the ears on my helmet.

I showed the people in a dream how the Ainu Nishpa had been unlucky and become poor, and how I had seen him being ridiculed and bullied by those who were once poor but now rich, and felt pity for him. I let them know that I was not just any god, but a god of high status, and that I had stayed in their human home and bestowed blessings upon them.

After that, as dawn approached, the people woke up together. Rubbing their eyes, they looked around the house and all collapsed onto the floor. The old woman cried out, and the old man shed large tears. But then, the old man stood up and came to me, bowing twenty or thirty times, and said,

"We thought it was just a dream, just sleep, but it really happened. It is too much, too much. We are grateful just for you coming to our humble home, but the god of the land, the Great God, has taken pity on our misfortune and bestowed upon us the greatest of blessings."

He said this while weeping.

Then, the old man cut down a tree for inau and made beautiful, splendid inau to decorate me.

The old woman dressed herself and had the small child help her gather firewood and draw water, preparing to make sake. In an instant, she lined up six sake barrels in the upper seat.

Then, I talked with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various other gods.

After two days, the scent of sake filled the house, as it is a favorite of the gods.

So, they deliberately dressed the small child in old clothes and sent him out to invite the people in the village who were once poor but now rich.

As they watched him go, the child entered each house and delivered his message. The people who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,

"This is strange. What kind of sake and what kind of feast could those poor people be making that they would invite people? Let's go see what's going on and laugh at them."

They gathered together and came to the house. From far away, just seeing the house, some were surprised and ashamed, and went home. Others came to the front of the house and collapsed in shock.

Then, the woman of the house came outside, took everyone's hand, and led them into the house. Everyone crawled in, unable to lift their faces.

Then, the master of the house stood up and spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird. He told the story of what had happened, saying,

"Like this, we were poor and unable to visit each other freely, but the Great God took pity on us. We had no bad intentions, so we received these blessings. From now on, we are all members of the same family in this village, so I hope that we can be friendly and visit each other."

The people rubbed their hands together many times and apologized to the master of the house for their sins, and discussed becoming friends from now on.

I was also worshipped by everyone.

When that was done, everyone's hearts softened and they held a grand feast.

I talked with the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the sacred shelf, watching the humans dance and leap, and was deeply amused. And after two or three days, the feast ended.

Seeing the humans being friendly with each other, I felt relieved and said goodbye to the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the sacred shelf.

When that was done, I returned to my own home.

Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful sacred treasures and fine sake.

So, I sent messengers to the gods near and far, inviting them to a grand feast. At the feast, I told the gods in detail about the situation in the human village when I visited it, and the events that had occurred. The gods praised me greatly.

When the gods left, I gave them two or three beautiful sacred treasures each.

Looking towards that Ainu village, it is now peaceful, and the humans are all friendly. That Nishpa is now the head of the village.

His child has now grown up, has a wife and children, and is filial to his parents.

Whenever they make sake, they always send me sacred treasures and sake at the beginning of the feast.

I sit behind the humans and always protect the human country.

So, the Owl God told his story.

This is the song of the Owl God, sung by himself:

"Silver drops fall, softly swirling,
Golden drops fall, gently unfurling."

Singing this song, I descended along the river's course, drifting over a human village. Looking down, I saw fortunes reversed: the poor of old now rich in purse, the rich of old now bearing life's curse.

By the seaside, human children played with toy bows and arrows, a carefree parade.

"Silver drops fall, softly swirling,
Golden drops fall, gently unfurling."

As my song echoed above the children's heads, they chased beneath me, their voices widespread:

"A beautiful bird! A god's own sign!
Hurry, shoot it down with arrows so fine!
He who fells that sacred bird and claims it his own,
Shall be hailed a true hero, his strength widely known!"

The children of those, once poor but now grand, nocked golden arrows to bows in their hand, and shot at me. I let those gilded shafts fly, some passing above, some beneath, toward the sky.

Among them, one child, with a simple wooden bow and arrow, joined the fray. His worn clothes spoke of poverty's sway. Yet, looking closely into his eyes, I saw a noble spark, a descendant of wise, a lone wolf spirit, in humble disguise. He, too, nocked his simple arrow, aiming for the skies.

The children of those, once poor but now bold, laughed with scorn, their taunts uncontrolled:

"How absurd, the poor child's plight!
That bird, that god's bird, scorns our gold so bright!
Why would it heed your rotten wooden dart,
You wretched child, with a broken heart?"

They kicked and shoved, their cruelty displayed. But he, undeterred, his focus stayed.

Seeing this scene, my heart filled with rue.

"Silver drops fall, softly swirling,
Golden drops fall, gently unfurling."

Singing this song, I circled in the vast expanse, a slow, deliberate dance. The poor child stood, one foot forward, one behind, biting his lip, his purpose defined, and released his arrow, with hope enshrined. The small arrow soared, a beautiful flight, and I reached out my hand, catching it just right.

Spinning and twirling, I danced on the breeze, descending with grace, putting hearts at ease.

The children ran, a sandstorm in their wake, each striving to be first, for victory's sake.
As I touched the ground, the poor child was there, his hand reaching out, his triumph to share.

Then, the children of those, once poor but now inflated, arrived with insults, their anger unabated, pushing and hitting, their envy activated.

"Hateful wretch, poor man's spawn!
You dared to seize what was rightfully drawn!"

The poor child shielded me, his body my guard, holding me close, against their disregard.

Struggling and wriggling, he broke free at last, and fled with speed, his shadow cast.

The children of those, once poor but now inflated, threw stones and wood, their malice related, but the poor child ran on, his spirit elated, until he reached a humble hut, his journey fated. He slipped me through the window, with words he did weave, telling the tale of hardship, that they might believe.

From inside the house, an old couple emerged, their eyes shaded by hands, their poverty urged. Though their clothes were worn, their spirits were bright, possessing the grace of a lady and knight. Seeing me, they bowed low, their surprise taking flight.

The old man straightened his belt, and bowed with respect, saying with words, carefully select:

"Owl God, Great God, we offer our thanks,
For gracing our humble home, despite our low ranks.
Once, we counted ourselves among the wealthy and bold,
But now we are paupers, our story unfolds.
To offer you lodging, Great God of the land,
Is presumptuous indeed, but we lend a helping hand.
As night has descended, we beg you to stay,
And tomorrow we'll send you with inau on your way."

He repeated his bows, again and again, showing reverence, easing the pain.

The old woman laid a mat, beneath the east light, placing me there, with care and with might.

Soon, everyone slept, their snores filled the air, while I, the Owl God, watched over their care.

I sat between the ears on my head, and then, as midnight approached, I rose from my bed.

"Silver drops fall, softly swirling,
Golden drops fall, gently unfurling."

Singing this song softly, I flew with grace, from the left side of the house to the right place.

As I flapped my wings, treasures divine, fell and scattered around, with a shimmering shine.

In an instant, the small house transformed, with magnificent treasures, divinely warmed.

"Silver drops fall, softly swirling,
Golden drops fall, gently unfurling."

Singing this song, I changed the small dwelling, into a house of gold, its grandeur compelling. I created a storehouse of riches untold, and fashioned splendid clothes, beautiful to behold.

I decorated the house, more lavish and grand, than any wealthy man's home in the land. When I was finished, I returned to my place, between the ears on my helmet, with time and with space.

I showed the people in a dream, the Ainu Nishpa's plight, how he'd fallen to poverty, losing his light, ridiculed and bullied, with all of his might. I felt pity for him, in his desperate state, and revealed that I was no ordinary god, but one of high fate, who had stayed in their home, to elevate.

After that, as dawn painted the sky, the people awoke, rubbing sleep from their eye. They looked around the house, their senses in shock, and collapsed to the floor, unable to unlock their frozen awe. The old woman cried out, her voice filled with dread, and the old man shed tears, his heart filled with lead.

But then, the old man stood, and came to my side, bowing deeply, his gratitude wide, saying with reverence, his emotions untied:

"We thought it a dream, a trick of the night,
But it truly occurred, bathed in divine light.
To grace our humble home, is a gift beyond measure,
But to ease our misfortune, and grant us such treasure,
Great God of the land, we are forever in debt,
For your boundless compassion, we shall never forget."

He spoke through his tears, his gratitude clear.

Then, the old man cut inau wood, crafting it with care, decorating me with beauty beyond compare.

The old woman dressed, with the child by her side, gathering firewood, drawing water with pride, preparing the sake, with nothing to hide. Six sake barrels lined up, in their rightful place, ready to honor the gods, with time and with grace.

Then, I spoke with the old woman of fire, the old goddess so wise, sharing stories of gods, reaching for the skies.

After two days passed, the scent of sake arose, a favorite of gods, as everyone knows.

So, they dressed the small child in old clothes, sending him forth, to spread the news, inviting the villagers, those who once did abuse, those who were poor, but now wealth infuse.

As they watched him depart, he delivered his plea, to each house he visited, with humility. The villagers laughed, their scorn on display, saying with mockery, in a disbelieving way:

"How strange, that the poor now invite,
What feast could they offer, to fill us with delight?
Let us go and see, and laugh at their plight."

They gathered together, and came to the door, but seeing the house, they could mock no more. Some were surprised, and ashamed to be seen, and turned away quickly, from the opulent scene.
Others reached the entrance, and collapsed in shock, unable to comprehend, the fortune they'd mock.

Then, the woman of the house, came forth with a smile, taking each hand, leading them inside, for a while. They crawled on the floor, unable to raise their head, humbled and ashamed, by the life they had led.

Then, the master of the house, stood tall and spoke clear, his voice like a cuckoo, dispelling all fear. He told the story of hardship, and how they had strived, and how the Great God, had mercifully arrived, saying with sincerity, his message alive:

"We were once poor, unable to freely roam,
But the Great God took pity, and made this our home.
We harbor no malice, no ill will to impart,
So we received these blessings, and a brand new start.
From now on, we are family, in this village we reside,
Let us be friendly and kind, with nothing to hide."

The people rubbed their hands, and apologized with grace, to the master of the house, for their sins they'd embrace, and promised to be friends, in this newly found space.

I was worshipped by all, their hearts now aligned, their spirits renewed, their futures entwined.

When that was done, their hearts softened and light, and they held a grand feast, filled with joy and with might.

I spoke with the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the sacred shelf, as quiet as a mouse, watching the humans dance, their spirits aroused, deeply amused, by the joy they espoused. And after two days, the feast came to end, with friendships renewed, and spirits to mend.

Seeing the humans, now friendly and kind, I felt relieved, leaving no one behind, and bid farewell to the gods, my purpose defined.

When that was done, I returned to my home, finding it filled, with treasures to comb, with sacred gifts and sake, to overcome.

So, I sent messengers forth, to gods near and far, inviting them all, to a feast beyond par. At the feast, I recounted, my journey with men, the village's condition, again and again. The gods praised my actions, their voices in blend, their admiration expressed, without end.

When the gods departed, I gave them each treasure, two or three sacred gifts, beyond all measure.

Looking towards the Ainu village, now peaceful and bright, the humans were friendly, their hearts filled with light. That Nishpa was leader, guiding their way, his child grown up, with each passing day, with a wife and children, their love on display, honoring his parents, in every way.

Whenever they made sake, they sent me a share, with sacred gifts and offerings, beyond compare.

I sit behind the humans, their guardian so true, forever protecting, the human world through.

So, the Owl God concluded, his story complete, a tale of compassion, both bitter and sweet.

The English translation is generally accurate but lacks the poetic and rhythmic quality of the original Japanese and the Chinese translation. It tends to be more literal, which makes it sound less engaging. The Chinese translation captures the lyrical essence better, using more evocative language and maintaining a consistent rhythm. For example, the repetition of "簌簌落下，灑滿四方" (sù sù luò xià, sǎ mǎn sì fāng) for "fall all around" is more poetic than the English version. The English translation could be improved by incorporating some of the stylistic choices made in the Chinese translation, such as using more vivid imagery and paying closer attention to rhythm and flow.

Comparison:
*   **Repetition:** Both translations retain the repetition of the core chant. However, the Chinese version's repetition sounds more natural and poetic.
*   **Imagery:** The Chinese translation uses slightly more vivid imagery. For example, describing the noble descendant as a "孤狼般，卓爾不群" (gū láng bān, zhuó ěr bù qún - a lone wolf, standing out from the crowd) is more evocative than "a lone wolf among the group."
*   **Flow:** The Chinese translation generally flows better due to its rhythmic structure and use of more descriptive language.

Improvements:
*   Incorporate more poetic language and imagery.
*   Pay closer attention to the rhythm and flow of the sentences.
*   Use more evocative descriptions to capture the essence of the original Japanese text.
*   Avoid overly literal translations that can sound clunky or awkward.
