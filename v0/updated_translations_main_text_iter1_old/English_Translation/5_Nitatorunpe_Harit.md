谷地の魔神が自ら歌った謡「ハリツ クンナ」

ハリツ クンナ
ある日に好いお天気なので
私の谷地に眼と口とだけ
出して見ていたところが
ずっと浜の方から人の話し声がきこえて来た.
見ると,二人の若者が連れだって来た.
先に来た者は勇者らしく勇者の品を
そなえて,神の様に美しいが
後から来た者を見ると,様子の悪い
顔色の悪い男で,何か話し合いながら
やって来たが私の谷地の側を通り
ちょうど私の前へ来ると,あとから来た顔色の悪い男が
立ち止り立ち止り自分の鼻をおおい
「おお臭い,いやな谷地,悪い谷地の前を通ったら
まあ汚い,何だろうこんなに臭いのは.」
と言った.
私はただ聞いたばかりだけれど自分の居るか居ないかも
わからぬほど腹が立った.
泥の中から飛び出した.私が飛び上ると
地が裂け地が破れる.牙を
鳴らしながら,彼等を強く追っかけたところが
先に来た者は,それと見るや
魚がクルリとあとへかえる様に引っかえして顔色の悪い男の
わきの下をくぐりずーっと逃げてしまった.
青い男を二間三間追っかけると
直ぐ追いついて頭から呑んでしまった.
そこで今度は彼かの男をありったけの速力で追っかけて来て
人間の村,大きな村の後へ着いた.
見るとむこうから
火の老女,神の老女があかい着物,六枚の着物に
帯をしめ,六枚の着物を羽織って
あかい杖をついて私の側へ飛んで来た.
「これはこれは,お前は何しにこのアイヌ村へ
来るのか,さあお帰り,さあお帰り.」
言いながら,あかい杖,かねの杖をふり上げて私を
たたくと,杖から焔が
私の上へ雨の様に降って来る.
けれども私はちっとも構わず,
牙打ち鳴らしながら彼の男を
追っかけると,彼の男は村の中を
よくまわる環の様に走って行く.そのあとを飛んで
行くと,大地が裂け大地が破れる.村中は大さわぎ
妻の手を引く者,子の手を引く者,泣き叫び
逃げゆくもの,煮えくりかえるようなありさま,けれども
私は少しも構わず,土吹雪
をたてる,火の老女神は私の側を走って来ると
大へんな焔が,私の上に飛び交う.
その中に,彼の男は一軒の家に
飛び込むと直ぐにまた飛び出した.
見ると,蓬の小弓に蓬の小矢をつがえて
むこうから,ニコニコして,私をねらっている.
それを見て私は可笑しく思った.
「あんな小さな蓬の矢,何で人が苦しむものか.」と
思いながら私は牙を打ち鳴らして,
頭から呑もうとしたら
その時彼の男は私の首ッ玉を
したたかに射た.それっきりどうしたか
わからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たところが
大きな竜の耳と耳の間に私はいた.
村の人々が集って,彼かの私が追っかけた若者が
大声で指図さしずをして,私の屍体をみんな細かに刻み
一つ所へ運んで焼いてその灰を
山の岩の岩の後へ捨ててしまった.
今になってはじめて見ると,それは,ただの人間
ただの若者だと思ったのは
オキキリムイ,神の勇者であった.
恐しい悪い神,悪魔神,私はそれであって
人間の村の近くにいるので,
オキキリムイは村の為を思って,私をおこらせ
自分を追いかけさせて,蓬の矢で私を殺したので
あった.それから,先に私が呑んでしまった
青い男は,人間だと思ったのだったが
それは,オキキリムイがその放糞を人に作り,
それを連れて来たのであった.
私は魔神であったから今はもう
地獄のおそろしい悪い国にやられたのだから
これからは,人間の国には,なんの危険も
ない,邪魔ものもないであろう.
私は恐しい魔神であったけれども,
一人の人間の計略にまけて
今はもう,つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
と谷地の魔神が物語りました.

沼澤魔神親口吟唱的歌謠：「哈利茲 昆納」

哈利茲 昆納，聽我細說從頭：

在一個風光明媚的好日子裡，
我從沼澤裡探出頭，只露出眼睛和嘴巴，
偷偷地窺視著外面的世界。
遠遠地，從海邊傳來了人聲。
我看到兩個年輕人結伴而來。

走在前面的那個，看來像個勇者，氣宇軒昂，
俊美得宛如天神下凡。
但走在後面的那個，卻是病懨懨的，面色蒼白，
一副倒楣相，真是不體面。

他們低聲細語，慢慢靠近，
直到我的沼澤近在眼前。
那個病弱的傢伙，突然停下腳步，大聲嚷嚷，
捏著鼻子，皺著眉頭，

「哎呀，好臭！這沼澤真是被詛咒了！
簡直臭氣熏天，世上最臭！」
聽到這些話，我怒火中燒，
簡直氣炸了，恨不得立刻宰了他們。

我從泥裡猛地跳了出來，
頓時地裂山崩，天翻地覆。
我齜牙咧嘴，朝他們猛追過去，
要把他們趕出這片聖地。

領頭的勇者見狀，立刻轉身，
像條魚兒般靈巧地一溜煙跑了。
他從那個倒楣鬼的腋下鑽過去，
頭也不回地逃之夭夭。

我追趕那個病鬼，
沒跑幾步就追上了他。
一口把他吞下，
奪走了他可悲的性命。

然後，我怒火轉向，用盡全力，
追趕那個逃走的勇者。
他一路狂奔，逃向一個大村莊，
那是人類的家園。

這時，從村莊裡走來一位
火焰老嫗，驅散了恐懼。
她身穿六層紅色長袍，
手持火焰杖，守護著秘密。

「你來我們愛努人的土地做什麼？
滾回去，可惡的傢伙，我命令你！」
她舉起火焰杖，
朝我打來，烈焰如雨。

但我毫不在意，
繼續齜牙咧嘴地追趕。
他在村子裡繞圈奔跑，
大地隨之崩裂。

村民們驚慌尖叫，四處逃竄，
拉著妻兒的手，哭喊著逃命。
一片混亂，恐懼蔓延，
但我依然緊追不捨。

火焰老嫗在我身旁奔跑，
火焰在我身上飛舞。
那勇者衝進一間屋子，
又立刻跑了出來。

只見他手持艾草小弓，搭上艾草箭，
笑嘻嘻地瞄準著我。
看到這情景，我覺得好笑。

「這麼小的艾草箭，怎麼可能傷得了我？」
我心想，同時齜牙咧嘴，
準備一口吞了他。

就在這時，他射出了致命的一箭，
正中我的要害。
我頓時失去了知覺，
眼前一片黑暗。

醒來時，我發現自己身處
一條巨龍的雙耳之間。
村民們聚集在一起，
那勇者大聲指揮。

他命令人們將我的屍體剁成碎片，
然後運到一處燒成灰燼，
再將灰燼丟棄在山岩後。

現在我才明白，我以為的普通人，
其實是奧基基穆伊，神之勇者。
我是可怕的惡神，
因為靠近人類的村莊，
奧基基穆伊為了保護村民，故意激怒我，
讓我追趕他，然後用艾草箭殺了我。

還有，之前我吞下的那個病鬼，
我以為是人類，
其實是奧基基穆伊用自己的糞便做成的。

我身為魔神，現在已經被
打入地獄，永世不得翻身。
從此以後，人類的國度，
將不再有任何危險。

我本是可怕的魔神，
卻敗在人類的計謀之下，
落得如此可悲的下場。
這就是沼澤魔神的故事。

The Mire Demon's Own Sung Ballad: "Haritsu Kunna"

Haritsu Kunna, hear my tale,
On a day of sunlit vale.
From my mire, just eyes and mouth,
I watched the world, from north to south.

Voices came upon the breeze,
From the shore, beneath the trees.
Two young men, I saw them stride,
Toward my mire, side by side.

The first, a hero, strong and bright,
A godlike beauty, filled with light.
The second, sickly, pale of face,
A wretched air, a foul disgrace.

They spoke in whispers, drawing near,
Until my mire was crystal clear.
The sickly one, he stopped and cried,
His nose he pinched, his face he hide.

"Oh, the stench! This mire is cursed!
A foulness here, the very worst!"
I heard his words, a burning sting,
My rage arose, on furious wing.

From the mud, I burst and flew,
The earth it cracked, the ground it knew.
With gnashing teeth, I gave them chase,
To banish them from this sacred place.

The hero saw, and turned with speed,
Like fish that twist, to plant a seed.
Beneath the wretch's arm he flew,
And fled away, from me and you.

The sickly man, I chased him down,
Two steps, three steps, then wore the crown.
I caught him quick, and swallowed whole,
His wretched life, I took his soul.

Then turned my wrath, with all my might,
To chase the hero, out of sight.
He fled toward a village grand,
A human place, in this fair land.

Then from the village, drawing near,
A fiery crone, dispelled all fear.
In robes of red, six layers deep,
A staff of fire, secrets to keep.

"What brings you here, to Ainu land?
Begone, foul beast, I command!"
She raised her staff, a fiery brand,
And struck at me, with burning hand.

Flames like rain, upon me fell,
But still I chased, with savage yell.
He ran in circles, round and round,
While earth did crack, with awful sound.

The village screamed, in wild dismay,
As parents fled, and children stray.
A boiling chaos, fear took hold,
But still I chased, so brave and bold.

The fiery crone, she ran beside,
With flames that danced, a burning tide.
The hero dove, into a home,
Then out again, no longer prone.

A bow of wormwood, in his hand,
An arrow notched, at my command.
He smiled at me, with steady gaze,
And aimed his shot, in cunning ways.

I laughed aloud, "A puny dart!
How can such weakness pierce my heart?"
I gnashed my teeth, prepared to feast,
To swallow him, both man and beast.

But then he struck, with deadly aim,
The arrow pierced, my vital frame.
I knew no more, my senses fled,
And darkness fell, upon my head.

I woke to find, a gruesome sight,
Between the ears, of dragon might.
The villagers, they gathered near,
The hero spoke, for all to hear.

He ordered them, with voice so strong,
To cut my corpse, where I was wrong.
They chopped me small, with blade and stone,
And burned my flesh, to leave me prone.

My ashes cast, behind the stone,
My reign of terror, overthrown.
I see it now, with fading breath,
He was no man, but faced with death.

Okikirmui, the hero bright,
Who saved his village, from my blight.
He angered me, and made me chase,
Then killed me swift, in this vile place.

The sickly man, I swallowed whole,
Was not a man, but took its toll.
Okikirmui, with cunning art,
Had made a thing, to play its part.

A demon I, now doomed to dwell,
In hellish realms, where shadows fell.
No more I'll haunt, the human land,
No more I'll threaten, with my hand.

A fearsome demon, I have been,
But tricked by man, a mortal sin.
A wretched death, a shameful end,
This is the tale, the mire did send.

The Mire Demon's Own Sung Ballad: "Haritsu Kunna"

Haritsu Kunna, listen to my tale:
On a beautiful, sunny day,
I peeked out from my mire, only my eyes and mouth visible,
Watching the world.
From the shore, I heard voices.
I saw two young men approaching together.

The first appeared to be a hero, possessing the qualities of a hero,
As beautiful as a god.
The second, however, was sickly, with a pale face,
An unsightly appearance.

They spoke quietly as they approached,
Until they were beside my mire.
The sickly man stopped, covering his nose,
And exclaimed,

"Oh, the stench! This mire is cursed!
So foul, the worst smell in the world!"
Hearing this, I was consumed with rage,
So angry I could barely contain myself.

I burst from the mud,
Causing the earth to crack and split.
With gnashing teeth, I chased after them,
To drive them away from this place.

The hero, seeing this, turned back quickly,
Like a fish turning in the water.
He slipped under the sickly man's arm,
And fled far away.

I chased after the sickly man,
Quickly catching up within a few steps.
I swallowed him whole,
Taking his miserable life.

Then, filled with wrath, I pursued
The hero with all my speed.
He fled towards a large village,
A human settlement.

From the village came
A fiery old woman, dispelling fear.
She wore six layers of red robes,
Holding a staff of fire, guarding secrets.

"What brings you to the land of the Ainu people?
Begone, foul creature, I command you!"
She raised her staff of fire,
Striking me, with flames like rain.

But I paid no heed,
Continuing to chase with gnashing teeth.
He ran in circles within the village,
Causing the earth to crack and split.

The villagers screamed in panic, fleeing,
Pulling their wives and children, crying and running.
A scene of chaos and fear,
But I continued my pursuit.

The fiery old woman ran beside me,
Flames swirling around me.
The hero dove into a house,
Then immediately ran out again.

He held a small wormwood bow, with a wormwood arrow notched,
Smiling as he aimed at me.
Seeing this, I found it amusing.

"How can such a small wormwood arrow harm me?"
I thought, gnashing my teeth,
Preparing to swallow him whole.

But then he released the arrow with deadly aim,
Piercing my vital spot.
I lost consciousness,
And darkness fell.

I awoke to find myself
Between the ears of a giant dragon.
The villagers gathered,
The hero spoke loudly, giving instructions.

He ordered them to cut my corpse into pieces,
Then carry them to one place and burn them to ashes,
And scatter the ashes behind a mountain rock.

Now I understand, the one I thought was just a man,
Was Okikirmui, the divine hero.
I was a terrible evil god,
And because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui deliberately angered me,
Made me chase him, and killed me with the wormwood arrow.

Furthermore, the sickly man I swallowed,
Was not a human,
But a creation of Okikirmui, made from his own excrement.

As a demon, I am now
Cast into a terrible, evil realm.
From now on, the human world
Will be free from danger and disturbance.

I was a fearsome demon,
But defeated by a human's scheme,
Now facing a meaningless, terrible death.
This is the story of the Mire Demon.

The English translation captures the essence of the Japanese text but loses some of the vivid imagery and emotional intensity present in both the Japanese and Chinese versions. The English translation uses rhyming couplets, which, while adding a poetic flair, sometimes forces word choices that dilute the original meaning. The Chinese translation is more literal and maintains a stronger connection to the original Japanese text's emotional tone and specific details.

Here's a comparison:

*   **Emphasis on Appearance:** The Chinese translation highlights the contrast between the hero's radiant appearance and the sickly man's wretched look more effectively than the English. The English translation uses "sickly, pale of face" and "wretched air, a foul disgrace," which are adequate but lack the punch of the Chinese description.
*   **Emotional Intensity:** The Chinese translation conveys the demon's rage more powerfully. Phrases like "怒火中燒 (nù huǒ zhōng shāo - burning with rage)" and "簡直氣炸了 (jiǎnzhí qì zhà le - utterly exploded with anger)" are stronger than "My rage arose, on furious wing."
*   **Specificity:** The Chinese translation includes details like the hero escaping under the sickly man's armpit, which is present in the Japanese text but less clear in the English translation ("Beneath the wretch's arm he flew").
*   **Cultural Nuances:** The Chinese translation mentions "愛努人 (Àinǔ rén - Ainu people)" explicitly, while the English translation only refers to "Ainu land." Including "Ainu people" adds a layer of cultural context.
*   **Clarity:** The Chinese translation makes it clearer that the sickly man was created from Okikirmui's excrement, a detail that is somewhat obscured in the English translation ("Had made a thing, to play its part").

To improve the English translation, I will:

*   Use more direct and evocative language to convey the demon's emotions and the characters' appearances.
*   Incorporate specific details from the Japanese text that are present in the Chinese translation but missing or vague in the original English translation.
*   Remove the rhyming structure to allow for more accurate and natural phrasing.
*   Maintain the original meaning and tone as closely as possible.
