Like innocent children, they were embraced by beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. They were truly the darlings of nature, such fortunate people!\\n\\nIn winter, they kicked away the thick snow covering the forests, braving the freezing cold to hunt bears across mountains and fields. In summer, accompanied by the songs of white gulls on the breezy, green-waved sea, they floated on leaf-like canoes, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they basked in the gentle sunlight, celebrating with the ever-singing birds, picking Fuki (蜂斗菜) and mugwort. In the autumn of fiery red leaves, they parted the wind-blown, neatly aligned Susuki (芒草), and until the bonfires for salmon fishing died out late at night, they dreamed under the bright moon, accompanied by the deer's calls in the valleys. Ah, what a joyful life! That peaceful state is now a thing of the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone drastic changes, with mountains and fields becoming villages, and villages becoming towns, gradually being developed.\\n\\nThe natural scenery of ancient times has gradually disappeared, and where have the many people who once lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? We, the few remaining of our people, can only stare in astonishment at the ever-advancing world. Moreover, the light of the beautiful souls, once governed by religious beliefs in every action, has vanished from those eyes, filled with anxiety and dissatisfaction, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others. What a pitiful sight! Ah, things on the verge of extinction... that is our current name, what a sad name we bear!\\n\\nLong ago, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would eventually become so miserable.\\n\\nTime flows on, and the world develops infinitely. In the fierce arena of competition, even as we now expose the ugly sight of defeat, someday, if two or three strong individuals emerge to walk alongside the ever-advancing era, that day will surely come. That is truly our fervent wish, the thing we pray for day and night.\\n\\nBut... our beloved ancestors, the many languages they used to communicate with each other in daily life, will all those beautiful words, worn out and left behind, also disappear mercilessly along with the weak who are about to perish? Ah, what a painful and regrettable thing that would be!\\n\\nAs an Ainu, raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights and snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather together and record, with clumsy strokes, a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors.\\n\\nIf these words can be read by the many who understand us, I will, together with our Ainu ancestors, feel immense joy and supreme happiness.\\n\\nMarch 1, Taisho 11 (1922)\\n\\nChiri Yukie\"\n",
