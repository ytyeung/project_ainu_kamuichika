The children would use these to shoot at trees or birds as targets, unknowingly mastering archery. ak... is archery, shinot is play, ponai is a small arrow.\\n\\n(2) shiktumorke... the look in one's eyes. It is said that to understand a person's true nature, looking at their eyes is the clearest way. If someone glances around too much, they would be scolded.\\n\\n(3) achikara... means 'dirty'.\\n\\n(4) Birds or animals are shot down because they wanted a person to make an arrow for them; they say it's to retrieve the arrow.\\n\\n(5) kotankorkamui... a god who owns a country or village. In the mountains, there is nupurikorkamui... a god who owns the mountain (bear), and nupuripakorkamui... a god who owns the east side of the mountain (wolf), etc. The owl's position is second only to the bear and wolf. kotankorkamui is not as rough or hasty as the mountain gods or the gods of the east side of the mountain. Therefore, they are usually calm and composed, always with their eyes closed, and only open them when something very important occurs.\\n\\n(6) eharkiso... the left seat.\\n\\n(7) eshiso... the right seat. There is a hearth in the center of the house, and the side with the window (※(「窗/心」)) is the seat of honor. Looking from the seat of honor, the right side is eshiso, and the left side is harkiso. Only men can sit in the seat of honor. Guests of lower status than the host will avoid sitting in the seat of honor. The host and his wife traditionally sit side by side in the right seat. Next to the right seat is the left seat, and the seat on the west side (near the entrance) is the lowest seat.\\n\\n(8) hayokpe helmet. When birds or animals are in the mountains, they are invisible to human eyes, but they each have houses like humans, and they all live the same lives as humans. When they come to human villages, they wear helmets.

Short tails, like those of dogs with broken tails, are not highly valued. wenpe... bad guy, and otuipe... a guy with a broken tail, are used to insult extremely insignificant people.\\n\\n(10) chikashnukar. When a god likes someone very much, they bestow great happiness on that person unexpectedly, and that person will say ikashnukar an to express their joy.\\n\\n(11) apehuchi... the old woman of fire. The fire goddess is the most honorable god in the house and is always an old woman. When mountain gods, sea gods, and other various gods come to the house as guests (like owls), this apehuchi presides over the reception and conversation. She can also be called kamuihuchi (god old woman) directly.\\n\\n(12) neusar talking to each other. Talking about various worldly matters is also called neusar. Generally speaking, things like kamuiyukar (god tales) or uwepeker (old tales) are called neusar.\\n\\n(13) ashke a uk. ashke is finger, hand. a uk is to take. It refers to inviting people when there is a celebration.\\n\\n(14) kakkokhau... the call of the cuckoo. The call of the cuckoo is clear and loud, so the cuckoo is used to describe someone who speaks clearly and understandably to everyone.\\n\\n(15) chisekorkamui... a god who owns the house. The fire god is like the housewife, and the house god is like the master of the house. Men are called chisekorekashi... the old man who owns the house.\\n\\n(16) nusakorkamui... a god who owns the altar, an old woman. The god of the altar must be female. When something happens, she will appear to humans, and it is said that she will borrow the shape of a snake to appear. Therefore, if a snake appears near the altar or near the east window, people will say, \\\"The old woman of the altar must have gone out on business,\\\" and they will never kill the snake. It is said that killing it will be punished.\"\n",

However, dry cattails cannot be woven directly, so they need to be slightly moistened before use. In this story, the woman probably brought them to the river for this reason.\\n\\n(2) i-okapushpa. People greatly dislike saying the names of deceased parents or relatives, or even talking about them in everyday conversation, which is called *i-okapushpa*. Also, digging up things that people have kept hidden and telling everyone, or bringing up past actions that are difficult for the person to hear, especially in front of them, is also called *i-okapushpa*.\\n\\n(3) nimakitara...... Baring fangs. This refers to a dog. When people go hunting in the mountains, they take dogs with them, and being attacked by a dog baring its teeth is the most frightening thing. Therefore, dogs are given this name to express fear.\"\n",
