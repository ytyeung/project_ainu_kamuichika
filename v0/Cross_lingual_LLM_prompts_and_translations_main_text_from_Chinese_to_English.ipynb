      "  \"translation\": \"The Song of the Owl God's Self-Narration:\\n\\n\\\"Silver drops, falling all around...\\\"\\n\\nI sing the song of \\\"Silver drops, falling all around, golden drops, falling all around,\\\" drifting down the river. As I pass over human villages, gazing down, I see the once impoverished now wealthy, and the formerly rich reduced to poverty.\\n\\nBy the sea, children play with toy bows and arrows.\\n\\nI sing the song of \\\"Silver drops, falling all around, golden drops, falling all around,\\\" flying over their heads. They run beneath me, crying out:\\n\\n\\\"What a beautiful bird! A god's bird! Quick, shoot it! Whoever hits this divine bird first will be the true hero, the true strong one!\\\"\\n\\nAnd so, the children, once poor but now rich, nock golden arrows onto golden bows and shoot at me. I let the golden arrows pass above and below me.\\n\\nAmong them, one child, with a simple wooden bow and arrow, joins the fray. I see him, dressed in the clothes of the poor. But looking closely at his eyes, I glimpse the spirit of a great ancestor. He is different, set apart, joining the children's game alone. He, too, aims his simple bow and arrow at me.\\n\\nThe children, once poor but now rich, laugh loudly, saying:\\n\\n\\\"How ridiculous, child of poverty! That bird, a god's bird, scorns even our golden arrows. Why would it pay attention to your rotten wooden stick? How could you ever hit that bird, a god's bird?\\\"\\n\\nThey kick and shove the poor child as they speak.\\n\\nBut the poor child pays them no mind, focusing intently on his aim. Seeing this, I feel pity.\\n\\nI sing the song of \\\"Silver drops, falling all around, golden drops, falling all around,\\\" slowly circling in the sky. The poor child, one foot forward, the other back, bites his lip and takes aim, then releases his arrow. The small arrow flies beautifully towards me, and I reach out and catch it.\\n\\nI spin, cutting through the sky, and descend gracefully. The children, seeing this, run, kicking up dust, scrambling to be first.\\n\\nAs I land, the poor child is the first to reach me, grabbing me tightly. The children, once poor but now rich, arrive moments later, shouting and shoving, striking the poor child.\\n\\n\\\"You wretch, child of poverty! Stealing from us!\\\"\\n\\nThe poor child clutches me tightly, pressing me to his stomach. He struggles, finally breaking free from the crowd, and runs.\\n\\nThe children, once poor but now rich, throw stones and wood at him, but the poor child ignores them, kicking up dust as he runs to the door of a small hut. He slips me through the first window and breathlessly tells the story to those inside.\\n\\nThe old couple inside shield their eyes and come out. Though poor, they possess the air of gentlefolk. Seeing me, they bow deeply, astonished.\\n\\nThe old man adjusts his belt and bows to me, saying:\\n\\n\\\"Owl God, great God, thank you for gracing our humble home. We were once wealthy, but now we are reduced to this. To have the nation's God, a great God, stay here fills us with trepidation. But as it is late, please rest here tonight, great God. Tomorrow, we will send you off with only Inau.\\\"\\n\\nHe bows again and again as he speaks. The old woman spreads a mat beneath the east window and places me there. Then, everyone sleeps, soon snoring loudly.\\n\\nI sit between my body, my ears, and after midnight, I rise.\\n\\nI quietly sing the song of \\\"Silver drops, falling all around, golden drops, falling all around,\\\" flying to the left and right of the house, making beautiful sounds. As I flap my wings, beautiful treasures, divine treasures, scatter around me with a clear sound.\\n\\nIn an instant, I transform the small hut into a place filled with magnificent treasures, divine treasures.\\n\\nI sing the song of \\\"Silver drops, falling all around, golden drops, falling all around,\\\" and in a flash, transform the small hut into a golden, spacious home, filled with magnificent treasures, divine treasures, and quickly create exquisite clothing, adorning the house.\\n\\nI decorate the spacious home more lavishly than a rich man's house. Having done all this, I return to my original form, sitting between my helmet, my ears.\\n\\nI give the family a dream, letting them know that the Ainu Nispa became poor due to bad luck, and was mocked and bullied by those once poor but now rich. Seeing this, I felt pity. Though I am but a humble god, I stayed in their home and bestowed blessings upon them.\\n\\nHaving done this, after a while, dawn breaks. The family rises together, rubbing their eyes, and look inside. They are all paralyzed with shock. The old woman cries loudly, and the old man sheds large tears.\\n\\nSoon, the old man rises and comes before me, bowing again and again, and says:\\n\\n\\\"We thought it was just a dream, but it is all real. We are grateful that you would grace our humble home. The nation's God, the great God, has pitied our misfortune and bestowed upon us great blessings.\\\" He says, weeping.\\n\\nThen, the old man cuts Inau wood and makes beautiful Inau, decorating me. The old woman also dresses up and has the child help her chop wood, draw water, and prepare to brew sake. In the blink of an eye, six barrels of sake are placed in the upper seat.\\n\\nThen, I speak of various stories with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various gods.\\n\\nAfter two days or so, because it is a food beloved by the gods, the house is filled with the aroma of sake.\\n\\nSo, I deliberately have the child put on old clothes and go to the village to invite the villagers who were once poor but now rich.\\n\\nAfter seeing the child off, the child goes from house to house, explaining the purpose. The villagers, once poor but now rich, laugh loudly.\\n\\n\\\"How strange, what sake can these poor people brew, what delicious food do they have that they would invite us? Let's go see what's so funny.\\\"\\n\\nThey come in groups, and from afar, just seeing the house, they are shocked and ashamed, and some return directly. Others come to the house and are paralyzed with shock.\\n\\nAt this time, the mistress of the house comes out, takes everyone's hand, and invites them inside. Everyone crawls forward, no one daring to look up.\\n\\nAt this time, the master of the house rises and speaks in a voice as beautiful as a cuckoo.\\n\\nHe tells the story from beginning to end.\\n\\n\\\"Like this, we poor people cannot interact with each other without barriers, but the great God has pitied us. We have no evil thoughts, so we have received such blessings. From now on, all the people in our village are one family, so I hope everyone can get along and interact with each other.\\\"\\n\\nAfter hearing this, people rub their hands again and again, apologize to the master of the house, and discuss getting along from now on.\\n\\nEveryone also bows to me.\\n\\nHaving done these things, people's hearts become gentle, and a grand banquet is held.\\n\\nI talk with the fire god, the house god, and the gods of the gohei shelf, while enjoying the sight of people dancing and singing, and I am very happy. Then, after two or three days, the banquet ends.\\n\\nSeeing the people getting along, I feel relieved, and I say goodbye to the fire god, the house god, and the gods of the gohei shelf.\\n\\nHaving done these things, I return to my home. Before I return, my home is already filled with beautiful gohei and delicious sake.\\n\\nSo, I send messengers to invite the gods from far and near, and hold a grand banquet. At the banquet, I tell the gods in detail about the village conditions and what happened when I visited the human village. The gods all praise me greatly.\\n\\nWhen the gods leave, I give them two or three beautiful gohei.\\n\\nLooking at that Ainu village, it has now returned to peace, and the people are getting along. That Nispa has become the leader of the village. His children are now grown, married, and have children, and are filial to their parents.\\n\\nWhenever and wherever they brew sake, they send me gohei and delicious sake at the beginning of the banquet.\\n\\nI also sit behind the humans, protecting the human country at all times.\\n\\nThe Owl God tells it this way.\"\n",

The demon's child,\\nSeeing this, merely laughed in triumph.\\nMy anger flared at the sight,\\nAnd I took out my small silver bow, notched a silver arrow,\\nAnd shot it towards the source.\\nFrom the source flowed silver water, clear and sweet,\\nThe salmon, who had wept as they left,\\nRegained their vigor in the clear water,\\nLaughing and playing,\\nSplashing and frolicking upstream.\\nThe demon's child then\\nRevealed his innate fury,\\n\\\"If you insist, I'll show you how to cut off the deer's path!\\\"\\nSaying this, he notched a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,\\nAnd shot it towards the sky,\\nThrough the trees of the mountain forests blew\\nA walnut wind, a whirlwind.\\nFrom the trees of the mountain forests, the stags on one side,\\nThe does on the other, were blown into the sky,\\nNeatly arranged, ascending to the heavens.\\nThe demon's child, seeing this, laughed in triumph.\\nMy rage knew no bounds,\\nAnd I took up my silver bow, notched a silver arrow,\\nAnd shot it towards the departing deer.\\nFrom the sky fell a silver wind, a refreshing wind,\\nThe stags on one side,\\nThe does on the other,\\nWere blown back to the trees of the mountain forests.\\nThe demon's child then\\nRevealed his innate fury,\\n\\\"Arrogant fool, if you\\nInsist on this, let us test our strength!\\\"\\nSaying this, he removed his upper garment.\\nI, too, was left in but a thin robe,\\nAnd grappled with him. He held me tight.\\nFrom then on, we wrestled and struggled,\\nBut the demon child's strength,\\nTruly astonished me. Yet, finally, at one moment,\\nI used the strength of my waist, the strength of my whole body,\\nAnd lifted the demon's child\\nOnto my shoulders,\\nSlamming him hard against the mountain rocks,\\nWith a thunderous crash. Having killed him, and kicked him into hell,\\nAll around was silent.\\nWhen it was over, I returned along the river,\\nAnd heard only the laughter of the salmon in the river,\\nThe sounds of their play, resounding merrily,\\nSplashing and frolicking. Through the trees of the mountain forests,\\nThe laughter of the stags and does,\\nThe sounds of their play, filled the air,\\nThey were there, they were here,\\nEating their fill. Seeing this,\\nI felt at peace, and returned to\\nMy home.\\nLittle Okikirmui tells it so.\"\n",

Do you have a mother?\\\"\\n\\nThe maiden, surprised, widened her eyes and looked around,\\nUpon finding me, her face filled with rage,\\n\\\"Ah, detestable flat-head, vile flat-head,\\nDaring to mock me!

Startled, I was,\\nI immediately dove to the river bottom, fleeing along the riverbed.\\n\\nThen, I arrived at the watering path of Okikirmui,\\nPeeking my head above the water once more.\\nThe sister of Okikirmui, equally divine in her beauty,\\nHeld a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.\\nSo I asked:\\n\\\"Do you have a father?
