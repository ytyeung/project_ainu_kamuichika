梟の神が自ら歌った謡
         「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
昔私の物言う時は桜皮を巻いた弓の
弓把きゅうはの央を鳴り渡らす如くに
言ったのであったが,
今は衰え年老いてしまった事よ.
けれども誰か雄弁で
使者としての自信を持ってる者があったら,
天国へ五ツ半の談判
を言いつけてやりたいものだ.」と
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
私は言った,ところが入口で誰かが
「私をおいて誰が使者として雄弁で
自信のあるものがあるでしょう.」というので
見ると鴉からすの若者であった.
私は家に入れて,それから,たがつきのシントコの
蓋の上をたたきながら
鴉の若者を使者にたてる為
その談判を云いきかせて三日たって
三つ目の談判を話しながら見ると
鴉の若者は炉縁の後で
居眠りをしている,それを見ると,癪しゃくに
さわったので鴉の若者を
羽ぐるみ引っぱたいて殺してしまった.
それから又たがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら
「誰か使者として自信のある者が
あれば天国へ五ツ半の
談判を言いつけてやりたい.」と
言うと,誰かがまた入口へ
「誰が私をおいて,雄弁で
天国へ使者に立つほどの者がありましょう.」
と言うので見ると山のかけす
であった.
家へ入れてそれからまた
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の談判を話して
四日たって,四つの用向を言っているうちに
山のかけすは炉縁の後で居眠りをしている.
私は腹が立って山のかけすを羽ぐるみひっぱたいて
殺してしまった.
それからまたたがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら,
「誰か雄弁で使者として
自信のある者があれば,天国へ
五ツ半の談判を持たせてやりたい.」
と言うと,誰かが
慎つつしみ深い態度ではいって来たので見ると
川ガラスの若者,美しい様子で
左の座に坐った.それで私は
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の用件を夜でも
昼でも言い続けた.見れば
川ガラスの若者,何も疲れた様子もなく
聞いていて昼と夜を
数えて六日目に
私が言い終ると直ぐに天窗から
出て天国へ行ってしまった.
その談判の大むねは,人間の世界に
饑饉があって人間たちは今にも
餓死しようとしている.どういう訳かと
見ると天国に
鹿を司つかさどる神様と魚を司る神様とが
相談をして鹿も出さず魚も出さぬことに
したからであったので,神様たちから
どんなに言われても知らぬ顔をして
いるので人間たちは猟に
山へ行っても鹿も無い,魚漁に
川へ行っても魚も無い.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
鹿の神,魚の神へ使者をたてた
のである.
それから幾日もたって
空の方に微かな音がきこえていたが
誰かがはいって来た.見ると
川ガラスの若者,今は前よりも美しさを増し
勇ましい気品をそなえて
返し談判を述べはじめた.
天国の鹿の神や魚の神が
今日まで鹿を出さず魚を出さなかった
理由は,人間たちが鹿を捕る時に
木で鹿の頭をたたき,皮を剥ぐと
鹿の頭をそのまま山の木原に
捨ておき,魚をとると
腐れ木で魚の頭をたたいて殺すので,
鹿どもは,裸で泣きながら
鹿の神の許もとへ帰り,魚どもは
腐れ木をくわえて魚の神の
許へ帰る.鹿の神,魚の神は
怒って相談をし,鹿を出さず
魚を出さなかったのであった.がこののち
人間たちが鹿でも魚でも
ていねいに取扱うという事なら鹿も出す
魚も出すであろう,と鹿の神と
魚の神が言ったという事を詳しく申し立てた.
私はそれを聞いてから川ガラスの若者に
讃辞を呈して,見ると本当に
人間たちは鹿や魚を
粗末に取扱ったのであった.
それから,以後は,決してそんな事をしない様に
人間たちに,眠りの時,夢の中に
教えてやったら,人間たちも
悪かったという事に気が付き,それからは
幣ぬさの様に魚をとる道具を美しく作り
それで魚をとる.鹿をとったときは,鹿の頭も
きれいに飾って祭る,それで
魚たちは,よろこんで美しい御幣ごへいをくわえて
魚の神のもとに行き,鹿たちは
よろこんで新しく月代さかやきをして鹿の神
のもとに立ち帰る.それを鹿の神や
魚の神はよろこんで
沢山,魚を出し,沢山,鹿を出した.
人間たちは,今はもうなんの困る事も
ひもじい事もなく暮している,
私はそれを見て安心をした.
私は,もう年老い,衰え弱った
ので,天国へ行こうと
思っていたのだけれども,私が守護している人間の国に
饑饉があって人間たちが餓死しようとしているのに
構わずに行く事が出来ないので,
これまで居たのだけれども,今はもう
なんの気がかりも無いから,最も強い者
若い勇者を私のあとにおき人間の世を
守護させて,今天国へ行く所なのだ.
と,国の守護神なる翁神(梟)が
物語って天国へ行きました.と.

Here's an English translation of the Japanese text, attempting to maintain a chant-like quality while preserving the original meaning:

**The Owl God's Own Song: "Konkwa"**

"Konkwa...
Of old, when I spoke,
My words rang like the twang
Of a cherry-bark bound bow,
Vibrating through the grip's core.
But now, I am weakened, grown old.

Yet, if there be one,
Eloquent, with the confidence of a messenger,
I would entrust them with a plea,
A five-and-a-half point negotiation to Heaven!
"
So I declared, striking the lid
Of the *shintoko* drum.
Then, at the entrance, a voice:
"Who but I is so eloquent,
So confident as a messenger?"
I looked, and it was a young crow.

I welcomed him in.
Then, striking the lid
Of the *shintoko* drum,
I charged the young crow as my envoy,
Revealing the full negotiation.
Three days passed, and as I spoke
The third point, I saw
The young crow dozing
Behind the hearth's edge.
Enraged, I seized him,
Feathers and all, and struck him dead!

Then again, striking the lid
Of the *shintoko* drum,
"Is there one with the confidence
Of a messenger, to carry
A five-and-a-half point plea to Heaven?"
And again, a voice at the entrance:
"Who but I is so eloquent,
So fit to stand as envoy to Heaven?"
I looked, and it was a jay from the mountains.

I welcomed him in.
Then again, striking the lid
Of the *shintoko* drum,
I spoke the five-and-a-half point plea.
Four days passed, and as I spoke
The fourth point, I saw
The mountain jay dozing
Behind the hearth's edge.
Enraged, I seized him, feathers and all,
And struck him dead!

Then again, striking the lid
Of the *shintoko* drum,
"Is there one eloquent,
With the confidence of a messenger,
To carry a five-and-a-half point
Negotiation to Heaven?"
Then, one entered with deference.
I looked, and it was a young river crow,
Beautiful in form,
Who sat to my left.
And so, striking the lid
Of the *shintoko* drum,
I spoke the five-and-a-half point plea,
Night and day, without cease.
And the young river crow,
Showed no sign of weariness,
Listening through the days and nights.
On the sixth day, as I finished,
He departed straight through the skylight,
And ascended to Heaven.

The gist of the plea:
Famine gripped the human world,
And the people were near starvation.
For the god who ruled the deer
And the god who ruled the fish
Had conspired in Heaven,
To withhold both deer and fish.
Deaf to all pleas,
Humans hunted in the mountains,
Finding no deer.
They fished in the rivers,
Finding no fish.
Enraged, I sent envoys
To the deer god and the fish god.

Many days passed,
And a faint sound echoed from the sky.
Then, one entered.
It was the young river crow,
Now more beautiful than before,
Adorned with valiant grace.
He began to speak the gods' reply:

"The deer god and the fish god
Have withheld deer and fish
Because humans, when they hunt deer,
Strike their heads with wood,
And when they skin them,
Leave the heads bare
Upon the mountain trees.
And when they catch fish,
They strike their heads with rotten wood.
The deer, naked and weeping,
Return to the deer god.
The fish, clutching rotten wood,
Return to the fish god.
The deer god and the fish god,
Enraged, conspired to withhold
Deer and fish.
But if humans will treat
Deer and fish with care,
Then deer and fish will be given."
So spoke the deer god and the fish god.

Hearing this, I praised the young river crow.
And it was true:
Humans had treated deer and fish
With disrespect.
From then on, I taught them in dreams,
Never to do so again.
And humans realized their error.
They crafted beautiful tools,
Like *nusa* offerings, to catch fish.
And when they caught deer,
They adorned the heads and offered them in ritual.
The fish, rejoicing, carried
Beautiful *gohei* offerings
To the fish god.
The deer, rejoicing, returned
With newly shaved forelocks
To the deer god.
The deer god and the fish god,
Rejoicing, released
Abundant fish, abundant deer.
Humans now live without want,
Without hunger.
Seeing this, I was at peace.

I am old, weakened, frail.
I had intended to ascend to Heaven.
But famine gripped the human land
I protect, and I could not bear
To leave them to starve.
So I remained.
But now, I have no worries.
I will leave behind the strongest,
The bravest youth, to protect
The human world in my stead.
And now, I ascend to Heaven."

So spoke the old god (the Owl),
Guardian of the land,
And ascended to Heaven.

## The Owl God's Song: "Konkwa"

"Konkwa...

In days of old, when I spoke, my voice resonated like the twang of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark, echoing through the very heart of the bow. But alas, I have grown old and feeble.

Still, if there be any among you, eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with a crucial negotiation – a "five and a half" matter – to be delivered to the heavens!"

So I declared, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest. Just then, a voice called out from the entrance, "Who could be more eloquent and confident than I to serve as your messenger?" I turned to see a young raven standing there.

I welcomed him inside and, tapping once more upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I began to explain the details of the negotiation, preparing the young raven for his mission. Three days passed, and as I was recounting the third point of the negotiation, I noticed the raven dozing off by the hearth. Enraged by his lack of attention, I seized him by his feathers and beat him to death.

Again, I tapped upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest and cried out, "Is there anyone confident enough to serve as my messenger, to carry this 'five and a half' matter to the heavens?"

And again, a voice answered from the entrance, "Who could be more eloquent than I, more worthy to stand as your messenger before the heavens?" This time, it was a jay from the mountains.

I invited him in and, tapping once more upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I began to explain the "five and a half" negotiation. Four days passed, and as I was detailing the fourth point, I saw the mountain jay fast asleep by the hearth. My anger flared, and I seized the mountain jay by his feathers and beat him to death.

Once more, I tapped upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest and proclaimed, "If there be any among you, eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with this 'five and a half' matter to be delivered to the heavens!"

This time, a figure entered with a humble demeanor. It was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance, who took a seat to my left. And so, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I continued to explain the "five and a half" matter, day and night. The young river crow listened without a hint of fatigue.

Six days and nights we spent in this way, and as soon as I had finished speaking, he departed through the skylight and ascended to the heavens.

The essence of the negotiation was this: a famine had struck the human world, and the people were on the verge of starvation. The reason, it turned out, was that the gods who governed the deer and the fish in heaven had conspired to withhold their bounty. No matter how much they were entreated, they remained unmoved. Humans who hunted in the mountains found no deer, and those who fished in the rivers found no fish.

Seeing this, I was filled with righteous anger and sought to send a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

Many days passed, and then, a faint sound echoed from the sky. Someone entered, and it was the young river crow, now even more beautiful and imbued with a valiant spirit. He began to deliver the gods' response.

The deer god and the fish god had withheld their bounty because of the way humans treated the deer and the fish. When humans hunted deer, they would strike the deer's head with wood, skin it, and then leave the head discarded in the forest. When they caught fish, they would kill them by striking their heads with rotten wood. The deer, naked and weeping, would return to the deer god. The fish, with rotten wood still clutched in their mouths, would return to the fish god. The gods, enraged, had conspired to withhold their bounty.

However, if humans would promise to treat the deer and the fish with respect, then the deer god and the fish god would release their bounty once more. This was the message delivered by the deer god and the fish god.

Hearing this, I praised the young river crow. And indeed, it was true that humans had been treating the deer and the fish with disrespect.

From then on, I taught the humans in their dreams to never repeat such actions. The humans realized their wrongdoings and began to craft beautiful tools, like sacred *nusa* offerings, to catch the fish. When they hunted deer, they adorned the deer's head and offered it in sacrifice. The fish, delighted, carried the beautiful *gohei* offerings to the fish god. The deer, joyful, returned to the deer god with newly shaved forelocks. The deer god and the fish god were pleased and released their bounty in abundance.

The humans now lived without hardship or hunger, and I was at peace.

I am old and feeble, and I had intended to ascend to the heavens. But I could not bear to leave the human realm, which I protect, while the people were suffering from famine. That is why I have remained until now. But now, with no more worries, I shall entrust the protection of the human world to the strongest and bravest among you, and ascend to the heavens.

And so, the old owl god, guardian of the land, finished his tale and ascended to the heavens.
