兎が自ら歌った謡「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら兄様のあとをしたって山へ行きました.
毎日毎日兄様のあとへ行って見ると
人間が弩いしゆみを仕掛けて置いてあるとその弩を兄様が
こわしてしまう,それを私は笑うのを
常としていたのでこの日また
行って見たら,ちっとも
思いがけない
兄様が弩にかかって泣き叫んでいる.
私はビックリして,兄様のそばへ
飛んで行ったら兄様は
泣きながら云うことには,
「これ弟よ,今これから
お前は走って行って
私たちの村の後へ着いたら
兄様が弩にかかったよ――,フオホホーイと
大声でよぶのだよ.」
私はきいて
ハイ,ハイ,と返辞をして,それから
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら来て
私たちの村の村後へ着きました.
そこではじめて兄様が私を使いによこしたことを
思い出しました,私は大声で叫び声を挙げようとした
が,兄様が何を言って私を使によこしてあったのか
すっかり私は忘れていました.そこに立ちつくして
思い出そうとしたがどうしてもだめだ.
それからまた
二つの谷を越え三つの谷を越え
後へ逆飛び逆躍びしながら
兄様のいる所へ来て
見ると誰もいない.
兄様の血だけがそこらに附いていた.
(ここまでで話は外へ飛ぶ)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
毎日毎日私は山へ行って
人間が弩を仕掛けてあるのをこわして
それを面白がるのが常であった所が
ある日また,前の所に弩が仕掛けて
あると,その側に小さい蓬よもぎの弩が
仕掛けてある,
私はそれを見ると
「こんな物,何にする物だろう.」
と思っておかしいので
ちょとそれに触って見た,直ぐに逃げようと
したら,思いがけ
なく,その弩にいやという程
はまってしまった.
逃げようともがけば
もがくほど,強くしめられるのでどうする事も
出来ないので,私は泣いて
いると,私の側へ何だか
飛んで来たので見るとそれは私の弟
であった.私はよろこんで,私たちの一族のものに
この事を知らせる様に言いつけてやったが
それからいくら待っても何の音もない.
私は泣いていると,私の側へ
人の影があらわれた.見ると,
神の様な美しい人間の若者
ニコニコして,私を取って,
どこかへ持って行った.見ると
大きな家の中が神の宝物で
一ぱいになっている.
彼かの若者は火を焚いて,
大きな鍋を火にかけて,掛けてある刀を引き抜いて
私のからだを皮のままブツブツに切って
鍋一ぱいに入れそれから鍋の下へ頭を突き入れ突き入れ
火を焚きつけ出した.どうかして
逃げたいので私は人間の若者の隙を
ねらうけれども,人間の若者はちっとも私から
眼をはなさない.
「鍋が煮え立って私が煮えてしまったら,なんにも
ならないつまらない死方,悪い死方をしなければならない.」と
思って人間の若者の油断を
ねらってねらって,やっとの事
一片の肉に自分を化かわらして
立ち上る湯気に身を交まじえて鍋の椽に
上り,左の座へ飛び下りると直ぐに
戸外へ飛び出した,泣きながら
飛んで息を切らして逃げて来て
私の家へ着いて
ほんとうにあぶないことであったと胸撫で下した.
後ふりかえって見ると,
ただの人間,ただの若者とばかり
思っていたのはオキキリムイ,神の様な強い方
なのでありました.
ただの人間が仕掛けた弩だと思って
毎日毎日悪戯をしたのをオキキリムイ
は大そう怒って蓬の小弩で
私を殺そうとしたのだが,私も
ただの身分の軽い神でもないのに,つまらない死方,悪い死方
をしたら,私の親類のもの共も,困り惑うであろう
事を不憫に思って下されて
おかげで,私が逃げても追いかけなかった
のでありました.
それから,前には,兎は
鹿ほども体の大きなものであったが,
この様な悪戯を私がしたために
オキキリムイの一つの肉片ほど小さくなったのです.
これからの私たちの仲間はみんなこの位の
からだになるのであろう.
これからの兎たちよ,決していたずらをしなさるな.
と,兎の首領が子供等を教えて死にました.

Here's a translation of the Japanese text into English, attempting to maintain a chant-like quality and preserve the original meaning:

**The Hare's Own Song: "Sanpaya Tereke"**

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys, three valleys I leap, I leap,
Following my elder brother, playing, to the mountains we creep.
Each day, each day, behind my brother I'd see,
A human's crossbow, set cunningly.
My brother would break it, with strength and with might,
And I would laugh, at the foolish human's plight.
But on this day, so unexpected and grim,
My brother was caught, by the crossbow's limb!

I startled, I flew, to my brother's side,
He wept, he cried, his voice open wide:
"Oh, little brother, now you must run,
Back to our village, when the setting sun.
Cry out, 'My brother is caught in the snare!'
'Foo-ho-ho-ee!' Let the message you bear!"

I heard his words, "Hai, hai!" I replied,
Across two valleys, three valleys I stride.
Playing, I came, to our village's rear,
Then remembered the message, filled with such fear.
I tried to shout, the words to proclaim,
But the message he gave me, I couldn't reclaim!
I stood there, frozen, my memory a haze,
Lost in the moment, in a bewildering maze.

Then back again, two valleys, then three,
Backward I hopped, in frantic decree.
To where my brother was, I desperately flew,
But he was gone, vanished from view.
Only his blood, stained the earth all around,
A silent testament, on hallowed ground.

(Here the story takes a turn)

Ketoka, woi woi, ketoka, ketoka, woi ketoka,
Each day, each day, to the mountains I'd go,
Destroying the crossbows, set by humans below.
Finding such joy, in their frustrated schemes,
But one day, I found, a different kind of dream.
A crossbow was set, in the very same place,
But beside it, a small, mugwort crossbow I trace.

I looked at it then, "What could this thing be?"
Amused by its size, so tiny to see.
I touched it, I poked it, intending to flee,
But unexpectedly, it ensnared me!
I struggled, I fought, with all of my might,
But the tighter it gripped, in the fading sunlight.
I wept in despair, with no escape in sight,
Then something flew near, in the dimming light.

It was my brother, I rejoiced at the sight,
I begged him to tell our kin of my plight.
But I waited and waited, no sound did I hear,
Just my own weeping, fueled by my fear.
Then a shadow appeared, beside where I lay,
A beautiful youth, like a god in display.

Smiling, he took me, and carried me far,
To a house filled with treasures, beyond any star.
He lit a fire, and set a great pot,
Drew out a sword, and my body he sought.
He chopped me to pieces, skin and all,
Filled the pot to the brim, answering the call.
Then he thrust my head down, beneath the pot's rim,
And stoked the fire, with a sinister whim.

I knew I must flee, from this terrible fate,
Or a meaningless death, would be all I create.
I watched for his weakness, a moment to seize,
And transformed myself, into a piece of the breeze.
A wisp of steam, rising high in the air,
I leaped to the edge, escaping the snare.
I jumped to the ground, and fled with a cry,
Back to my home, beneath the wide sky.

I arrived at my home, my heart filled with dread,
Relieved to be safe, from the clutches of the dead.
Looking back then, I understood the truth,
The human, the youth, was no ordinary sleuth.
But Okikirmui, a god of great power,
Whose anger I'd drawn, in that terrible hour.

For my mischief and pranks, he sought to destroy,
With the mugwort crossbow, my life to deploy.
But I am no mere god, of insignificant name,
A meaningless death, would bring only shame.
My kin would be troubled, their hearts filled with woe,
So he spared me, and let me go.

From that day forward, the hare's size decreased,
From as big as a deer, to a fragment, at least.
Of Okikirmui's flesh, a small piece indeed,
And all of our kind, will follow this creed.
So listen, young hares, and heed my last breath,
Never play pranks, that lead you to death!"
Thus spoke the hare chief, his lesson complete,
And died, leaving wisdom, bittersweet.

This is the song of the rabbit, called "Sanpaya Tereke":

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys, across three valleys I hopped,
Following my elder brother, playing as I went, to the mountains.
Every day I followed my brother, and I saw
Humans had set a crossbow trap. My brother
Would break the trap, and I would laugh.
This was my habit, so on this day, again
I went, and unexpectedly,
My brother was caught in the trap, crying out in pain.
I was shocked, and flew to my brother's side.
He said to me, weeping,
"Listen, little brother, you must run now
Back to our village, and when you reach the edge,
Shout out, 'Brother is caught in a trap! Hoo-ho-hoi!'"
I listened, and replied,
"Yes, yes," and then,
Across two valleys, across three valleys I hopped,
Playing as I went, until
I reached the edge of our village.
There, I finally remembered why my brother had sent me.
I tried to shout out the message,
But I had completely forgotten what my brother had told me to say.
I stood there, trying to remember, but I couldn't.
So then, again,
Across two valleys, across three valleys,
Backwards I hopped and skipped,
Back to where my brother was.
But he was gone.
Only his blood remained.

(Here the story takes a turn)

Ketoka, woioi ketoka, ketoka, woi ketoka.
Every day I went to the mountains,
Breaking the crossbow traps set by humans,
And enjoying the mischief.
But one day, at the usual place, there was a trap,
And beside it, a small mugwort crossbow.
When I saw it, I thought,
"What is this thing for?"
And because it seemed funny,
I touched it. I tried to run away,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in the trap, tighter than I could bear.
The more I struggled to escape,
The tighter it squeezed, and I could do nothing.
I was crying,
When something flew to my side.
It was my younger brother. I was happy, and told him
To tell our family what had happened.
But no sound came.
As I wept, a shadow
Appeared beside me. It was
A beautiful young man, like a god.
Smiling, he took me
And carried me away. I saw
A large house filled with divine treasures.
The young man lit a fire,
Put a large pot over the flames, drew a sword,
And cut my body, skin and all, into pieces,
Filling the pot. Then he put his head under the pot,
Stoking the fire. I wanted to escape,
So I watched for an opening.
But the young man never took his eyes off me.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked, I will die
A meaningless, terrible death," I thought.
I watched and waited for the young man to let his guard down.
Finally, I transformed myself into a single piece of meat,
Mixed myself with the rising steam, climbed to the edge of the pot,
Jumped to the left side, and immediately
Leapt out the door. Crying,
I flew, breathless,
Back to my home,
Relieved that I had escaped such danger.
Looking back,
I realized that the man, the young man,
Was not just a human, but Okikirmui, a god of great power.
Okikirmui was very angry that I had played pranks
On the traps set by humans, so he tried to kill me
With the small mugwort crossbow. But I, too,
Am not just a god of low status. If I had died a meaningless, terrible death,
My relatives would have been troubled and confused.
He took pity on me,
And that is why he did not chase me when I escaped.
Before this, rabbits
Were as large as deer.
But because of the mischief I caused,
Okikirmui made me as small as one of his pieces of meat.
From now on, all of our kind will be this size.
From now on, rabbits, never play pranks.
And with these words, the rabbit chief taught his children and died.
