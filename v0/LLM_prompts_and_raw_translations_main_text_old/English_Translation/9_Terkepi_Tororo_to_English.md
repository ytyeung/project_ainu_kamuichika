蛙が自らを歌った謡
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」

トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!
「ある日に,草原を飛び廻って
遊んでいるうちに見ると,
一軒の家があるので戸口へ行って
見ると,家の内に宝の積んである側に
高床がある.その高床の上に
一人の若者が鞘を刻んでうつむいて
いたので,私は悪戯をしかけようと思って敷居の上に
坐って,「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴いた,ところが,彼の若者は刀持つ手を上げ
私を見ると,ニッコリ笑って,
「それはお前の謡かえ? お前の喜びの歌かえ?
もっと聞きたいね.」というので
私はよろこんで「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴くと,彼の若者のいう事には,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」
私はそれをきいて嬉しく思い下座の方の
炉縁の上へピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴くと
彼の若者のいうことには,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」それを聞くと私は,
本当に嬉しくなって,上座の方の炉縁の
隅のところへピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴いたら
突然!彼の若者がパッと起ち
上ったかと思うと,大きな薪の燃えさしを
取り上げて私の上へ投げつけた音は
体の前がふさがったように思われて,それっきり
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たら
芥捨あくすて場の末に,一つの腹のふくれた蛙が
死んでいて,その耳と耳との間に私はすわっていた.
よく見ると,ただの人間の家
だと思ったのは,オキキリムイ,神の様に
強い方の家なのであった,そして
オキキリムイだという事も知らずに
私が悪戯をしたのであった.
私はもう今この様につまらない死方,悪い死方
をするのだから,これからの
蛙たちよ,決して,人間たちに悪戯をするのではないよ.
と,ふくれた蛙が云いながら死んでしまった.

Okay, here's an English translation that attempts to capture the chant-like quality and retain the original meaning:

**The Frog's Self-Sung Song**
"TORORO HANROKU HANROKU!"

TORORO HANROKU HANROKU!
One day, I hopped the fields so wide,
Playing, leaping, with naught to hide.
A house I spied, a dwelling small,
I went to the door, heedless of all.

Inside the house, a treasure gleamed,
Beside a platform, so it seemed.
Upon that platform, a youth sat low,
Carving a sheath, with head hung so.

A trick I'd play, a jest I'd make,
Upon the threshold, my seat I take.
"TORORO HANROKU HANROKU!" I cried,
But the youth looked up, his work aside.

He raised his hand, that held the blade,
And smiled at me, unafraid.
"Is that your song? Your joyful sound?
More I would hear, on hallowed ground."

Pleased was I, to hear him say,
"TORORO HANROKU HANROKU!" I sang that day.
Then spoke the youth, with gentle plea,
"Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau, free?
Closer I'd listen, to your sweet call."

My heart it leaped, I knew no fall,
To the hearth's edge, I hopped with glee,
"TORORO HANROKU HANROKU!" sang I.

Again he spoke, with voice so mild,
"Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau, wild?
Closer I'd listen, to your sweet lay."
Joy filled my heart, I could not stay.

To the upper hearth, I made my leap,
To the corner's edge, my promise to keep.
"TORORO HANROKU HANROKU!" I cried with might,
Then sudden! The youth rose in the light!

He snatched a brand, a burning coal,
And flung it at me, to claim my soul!
A wall of fire, before my face,
I knew no more, in that desolate place.

I woke to find, in a wretched plight,
At the edge of the dump, in fading light.
A bloated frog, lay still and dead,
Between its ears, I made my bed.

Then I saw, with dawning dread,
Not a human home, but a place instead,
Of Okikirmui, strong and grand,
A god's own house, in this sacred land.

Unknowing, I played my foolish game,
And now I die, in sorrow and shame.
So heed my words, you frogs so small,
Never trick humans, lest you fall.

Thus spoke the frog, with final breath,
And succumbed to the cold embrace of death.

This is the song of a frog, telling his own tale:

"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

"One day, as I hopped and played through the meadow, I spied a house. I went to the doorway and peered inside. There, amidst a pile of treasures, was a raised platform. Upon that platform sat a young man, carving a sheath, his head bowed low.

Thinking to play a trick, I sat upon the threshold and sang out, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

The young man raised his hand, the one holding the knife, and looked at me. He smiled gently and said, "Is that your song? Your song of joy? I would like to hear more."

Pleased, I sang again, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

The young man then asked, "Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau? I would like to hear it closer."

Hearing this, I was delighted! I hopped down to the lower hearth and sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

Again, the young man said, "Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau? I would like to hear it closer."

My heart swelled with joy! I hopped to the corner of the upper hearth and sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"

Suddenly! The young man leaped to his feet! He grabbed a burning log and threw it at me! I felt as though the world had closed in around me, and then... I knew no more.

When I awoke, I was at the edge of the garbage heap. A bloated frog lay dead, and I was perched between its ears.

Looking closer, I realized that what I had thought was a simple human house was, in fact, the home of Okikirmui, a god of immense power! And I, without knowing, had played a trick on him.

Now, I die this foolish, this wretched death. So, I say to all frogs who come after me: Never, ever play tricks on humans!

And with those words, the bloated frog breathed his last."
