      "  \"updated_translation\": \"## The Song of the Owl God Himself:\\n\\n\\\"Silver drops, falling all around...\\\"\\n\\nI sing the song: \\\"Silver drops falling all around, golden drops falling all around,\\\" as I drift down the river. Glancing down upon the human villages, I see those once impoverished now wealthy, and the formerly rich reduced to poverty.\\n\\nBy the sea, children play with toy bows and arrows.\\n\\nSinging, \\\"Silver drops falling all around, golden drops falling all around,\\\" I fly over them. They run beneath me, crying out:\\n\\n\\\"A beautiful bird! A god's bird! Quick, shoot it down! Whoever hits this divine bird first will be the true hero, the true strong one!\\\"\\n\\nAnd so, the children, once poor but now rich, nock golden arrows onto golden bows and shoot at me. I let the golden arrows pass above and below.\\n\\nAmong them, one child, with a simple wooden bow and arrow, joins the game. I see him, dressed in the clothes of the poor. But looking closely into his eyes, I glimpse the spirit of a great ancestor. He is different, set apart, joining the children's game alone. He, too, aims his simple bow and arrow at me.\\n\\nThe children, once poor but now rich, laugh loudly, saying:\\n\\n\\\"How ridiculous, child of poverty! That bird, a god's bird, scorns even our golden arrows. Why would it pay attention to your rotten wooden stick? How could you ever hit that bird, a god's bird?\\\"\\n\\nThey kick and shove the poor child as they speak.\\n\\nBut the poor child pays them no mind, focusing intently on his aim. Seeing this, I feel pity.\\n\\nI sing the song: \\\"Silver drops falling all around, golden drops falling all around,\\\" slowly circling in the sky. The poor child, one foot forward, the other back, bites his lip and takes aim, then releases his arrow. The small arrow flies beautifully towards me, and I reach out and catch it.\\n\\nSpinning, I dance on the wind and descend gracefully. The children, seeing this, run, kicking up dust, scrambling to be first.\\n\\nAs I land, the poor child is the first to reach me, grabbing me tightly. The children, once poor but now rich, arrive moments later, shouting and shoving, striking the poor child.\\n\\n\\\"You wretch, child of poverty! Stealing what was meant for us!\\\"\\n\\nThe poor child clutches me tightly, pressing me to his stomach. He struggles, finally breaking free from the crowd, and runs.\\n\\nThe children, once poor but now rich, throw stones and wood at him, but the poor child ignores them, kicking up dust as he runs to the door of a small hut. He slips me through the first window and breathlessly tells the story to those inside.\\n\\nThe old couple inside shield their eyes and come out. Though poor, they possess the air of gentlefolk. Seeing me, they bow deeply, astonished.\\n\\nThe old man adjusts his belt and bows to me, saying:\\n\\n\\\"Owl God, great God, thank you for gracing our humble home. We were once wealthy, but now we are reduced to this. To have the nation's God, a great God, stay here fills us with trepidation. But as it is late, please rest here tonight, great God. Tomorrow, we will send you off with only *Inau* (ceremonial wooden sticks).\\\"\\n\\nHe bows again and again as he speaks. The old woman spreads a mat beneath the east window and places me there. Then, everyone sleeps, soon snoring loudly.\\n\\nI sit between my ears, atop my head, and after midnight, I rise.\\n\\nI quietly sing the song: \\\"Silver drops falling all around, golden drops falling all around,\\\" flying to the left and right of the house, making beautiful sounds. As I flap my wings, beautiful treasures, divine treasures, scatter around me with a clear sound.\\n\\nIn an instant, I transform the small hut into a place filled with magnificent treasures, divine treasures.\\n\\nI sing the song: \\\"Silver drops falling all around, golden drops falling all around,\\\" and in a flash, transform the small hut into a golden, spacious home, filled with magnificent treasures, divine treasures, and quickly create exquisite clothing, adorning the house.\\n\\nI decorate the spacious home more lavishly than a rich man's house. Having done all this, I return to my original form, sitting between my helmet, my ears.\\n\\nI give the family a dream, letting them know that the Ainu *Nispa* (a term of respect), became poor due to bad luck, and was mocked and bullied by those once poor but now rich. Seeing this, I felt pity. Though I am but a humble god, I stayed in their home and bestowed blessings upon them.\\n\\nHaving done this, after a while, dawn breaks. The family rises together, rubbing their eyes, and look inside. They are all paralyzed with shock. The old woman cries loudly, and the old man sheds large tears.\\n\\nSoon, the old man rises and comes before me, bowing again and again, and says:\\n\\n\\\"We thought it was just a dream, but it is all real! We are grateful that you would grace our humble home. The nation's God, the great God, has pitied our misfortune and bestowed upon us great blessings!\\\" He says, weeping.\\n\\nThen, the old man cuts *Inau* wood and makes beautiful *Inau*, decorating me. The old woman also dresses up and has the child help her chop wood, draw water, and prepare to brew sake. In the blink of an eye, six barrels of sake are placed in the upper seat.\\n\\nThen, I speak of various stories with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various gods.\\n\\nAfter two days or so, because it is a food beloved by the gods, the house is filled with the aroma of sake.\\n\\nSo, I deliberately have the child put on old clothes and go to the village to invite the villagers who were once poor but now rich.\\n\\nAfter seeing the child off, the child goes from house to house, explaining the purpose. The villagers, once poor but now rich, laugh loudly.\\n\\n\\\"How strange, what sake can these poor people brew, what delicious food do they have that they would invite us? Let's go see what's so funny.\\\"\\n\\nThey come in groups, and from afar, just seeing the house, they are shocked and ashamed, and some return directly. Others come to the house and are paralyzed with shock.\\n\\nAt this time, the mistress of the house comes out, takes everyone's hand, and invites them inside. Everyone crawls forward, no one daring to look up.\\n\\nAt this time, the master of the house rises and speaks in a voice as beautiful as a cuckoo.\\n\\nHe tells the story from beginning to end.\\n\\n\\\"Like this, we poor people cannot interact with each other without barriers, but the great God has pitied us. We have no evil thoughts, so we have received such blessings. From now on, all the people in our village are one family, so I hope everyone can get along and interact with each other.\\\"\\n\\nAfter hearing this, people rub their hands again and again, apologize to the master of the house, and discuss getting along from now on.\\n\\nEveryone also bows to me.\\n\\nHaving done these things, people's hearts become gentle, and a grand banquet is held.\\n\\nI talk with the fire god, the house god, and the gods of the *gohei* (sacred paper streamers) shelf, while enjoying the sight of people dancing and singing, and I am very happy. Then, after two or three days, the banquet ends.\\n\\nSeeing the people getting along, I feel relieved, and I say goodbye to the fire god, the house god, and the gods of the *gohei* shelf.\\n\\nHaving done these things, I return to my home. Before I return, my home is already filled with beautiful *gohei* and delicious sake.\\n\\nSo, I send messengers to invite the gods from far and near, and hold a grand banquet. At the banquet, I tell the gods in detail about the village conditions and what happened when I visited the human village. The gods all praise me greatly.\\n\\nWhen the gods leave, I give them two or three beautiful *gohei*.\\n\\nLooking at that Ainu village, it has now returned to peace, and the people are getting along. That *Nispa* has become the leader of the village. His children are now grown, married, and have children, and are filial to their parents.\\n\\nWhenever and wherever they brew sake, they send me *gohei* and delicious sake at the beginning of the banquet.\\n\\nI also sit behind the humans, protecting the human country at all times.\\n\\nThe Owl God tells it this way.\"\n",

Thus,\\nthe fish joyfully carried beautiful *gohei* (paper streamers) offerings to the fish god, and the deer\\nhappily groomed their *sakayaki* (hair on the head), returning to the deer god.

When the meal was done,\\nmy brothers would busily craft arrows.\\nOnce the quivers were full, they would all be so tired\\nthey would fall asleep, their snores shaking the heavens.\\n\\nThe next day, before dawn,\\nthey would all rise, my sisters preparing the meal and setting a tray for me.\\nWhen everyone had eaten, they would again shoulder their quivers\\nand depart. Again, in the evening,\\nthey would return with weary faces, their hands empty,\\nmy sisters preparing the meal, my brothers making arrows,\\nalways repeating the same tasks, year after year.\\n\\nOne day, my brothers and sisters again\\nshouldered their quivers and went out.\\nI, who had been carving treasures, soon\\nrose from the platform, took a golden bow\\nand golden arrows, and went outside.\\n\\nThe sea was vast and calm,\\nwhales playing to the east and west,\\nsplashing and frolicking. Then,\\nto the east, my eldest sisters, six in number, joined hands to form a ring,\\nmy younger sisters, six in number, driving the whales into the ring.\\nMy eldest brothers, six in number, my younger brothers, six in number,\\naimed and shot at the whales within the ring, their arrows\\npassing beneath and skimming above the whales.\\nEvery day, they did this.\\n\\nI saw in the center of the sea\\na giant whale and her calf playing,\\nleaping up and down. From afar,\\nI nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow\\nand aimed, piercing both the whale and its calf with a single shot.\\n\\nThen, I cut one of the whales in half\\nand threw half into my sisters' ring.\\nWith the remaining whale and a half,\\nI placed it tail-down and headed towards the land of humans,\\narriving at Otasutsu village.\\nI pushed that half-whale\\nonto the village beach.\\n\\nThen, I slowly\\nswam back across the sea,\\nwhen someone came running beside me,\\nout of breath. It was the sea grebe.\\nBreathlessly, it said,\\n\\\"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru\\nBrave Kamuy, Great Kamuy,\\nwhy have you bestowed such a great sea bounty upon the lowly humans, the wicked humans?\\nThe lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes\\nand sickles to cut, poke, and scrape away at the great sea bounty.\\nBrave Kamuy,\\nGreat Kamuy, please quickly\\ntake back the sea bounty! Even though you have given them so much,\\nthe lowly humans, the wicked humans,\\ndo not appreciate it and do such things!\\\"\\n\\nSo I laughed and said,\\n\\\"I have given it to the humans,\\nso now it is theirs. Let the humans\\ncut it with sickles or\\nscrape it with axes, let them eat it as they please.\\nWhat does it matter?\\\" The sea grebe seemed discomfited,\\nbut I paid it no mind and slowly swam across the sea,\\narriving at my sea as the day was ending.\\n\\nI saw\\ntwelve brothers, twelve\\nsisters, unable to carry that half-whale,\\nstruggling together, shouting loudly,\\ngrumbling to the east of the sea.\\nI was truly amazed.\\n\\nI ignored them and went home,\\nsitting on the platform.\\nThen, looking back towards the human world,\\nI saw fine men and\\nfine women surrounding the half-whale I had beached,\\ndressed in finery, rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty,\\nand on the dunes behind,\\na fine mat was spread,\\nand upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,\\nbound in six layers of kimono and sash, wearing six layers of kimono,\\ncrowned with a magnificent god's crown, an ancestral crown,\\na divine sword at his waist,\\nlooking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high\\nin prayer. The humans were crying\\nand rejoicing over the sea bounty.\\n\\nWhat the grebe said about the humans\\npoking at the whale I had beached with axes and sickles was wrong.\\nThe village chief and\\nthe villagers were taking out the divine sword,\\nwhich they had always considered the most precious of treasures,\\nand using it to cut the meat and carry it away.\\n\\nThen, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.\\nTwo or three days passed, and something seemed to appear in the window.\\nLooking back, I saw in the window\\na golden cup overflowing\\nwith sake, and upon it\\nwere ceremonial chopsticks adorned with Nusa,\\ncoming and going, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,\\n\\\"I am from Otasutsu village,\\nand with great reverence, I offer you this sake.\\\"\\nThe village chief of Otasutsu village,\\nrepresenting all the villagers,\\nexplained in detail how he was expressing his gratitude to me,\\nsaying,\\n\\\"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru\\nGreat Kamuy, Brave Kamuy, who else\\nwould have pity on our village, which was suffering from famine\\nand was in such dire straits\\nthat we had no food?\\nThank you truly for giving life to our village.\\nRejoicing in the sea bounty,\\nwe have made a little sake,\\nadded a small Nusa,\\nand are offering our thanks to the Great Kamuy.\\\"\\nThis was what\\nthe Nusa-adorned chopsticks conveyed, coming and going.\\n\\nSo I rose, took the golden cup,\\nheld it high,\\nopened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,\\npoured a little of the fine sake into each,\\nand placed the golden cup in the window.\\nWhen that was done, I sat down on the platform\\nand saw that the cup and chopsticks\\nwere gone. Then, carving\\nand engraving scabbards, I\\nsuddenly looked up,\\nand the house was filled with beautiful Inao,\\nwhite clouds drifting through the house, white lightning\\nflashing brightly. I thought, \\\"Ah, how beautiful.\\\"\\n\\nThen, again, two or three days passed,\\nand at last, I heard my brothers and\\nsisters outside the house, shouting loudly as they\\npulled the whale.\\nI was amazed.\\nWatching them enter the house,\\nmy brothers and sisters were\\nvery tired, their faces pale.\\nEveryone came in, and when they saw the many Inao,\\nthey were surprised and bowed many times.\\nMeanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat\\nwere overflowing, and the scent of the Kamuy's favorite\\nsake filled the house.\\n\\nThen I decorated the house with beautiful Inao,\\ninvited the Kamuy of far and near,\\nand held a grand banquet. My sisters\\nboiled the whale and offered it to the Kamuy,\\nwho smacked their lips and rejoiced.\\nWhen the banquet was at its height, I rose\\nand told in detail how there was a famine in the human world\\nand how I had taken pity on them and beached the sea bounty,\\nhow the wicked Kamuy were jealous of this\\nand how the sea grebe had slandered me,\\nand how the village chief of Otasutsu village\\nhad expressed his gratitude to me in such words\\nand how the Nusa-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy.\\nThe Kamuy\\nnodded in unison,\\npraising me.\\n\\nThen, again, we held a grand banquet,\\nand the sounds of the Kamuy\\ndancing and leaping here and there\\nmade a beautiful harmony, and my sisters\\ncarried pitchers, serving sake between the seats,\\nand sang with beautiful voices along with the goddesses.\\nThe banquet ended after two or three days.\\nI gave the Kamuy two or three beautiful Inao each,\\nand the Kamuy bent low at the waist,\\nbowing many times, and\\neach returned to their own home.\\n\\nAfter that, as always, my eldest brothers, six in number,\\nmy eldest sisters, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,\\nmy younger brothers, six in number, were with me,\\nand whenever the humans made sake,\\nthey would send sake and Inao to me.\\nNow, the humans have no lack of food\\nand live in peace without any trouble,\\nso I am at ease.\"\n",
