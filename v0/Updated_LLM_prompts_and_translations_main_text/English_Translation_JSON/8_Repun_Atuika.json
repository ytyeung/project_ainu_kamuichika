My sisters,\ndespited their weariness, would prepare the meal, setting a tray before me,\nthen eating themselves. When the meal was done,\nmy brothers would busily make arrows.\nWhen the quivers were full, they would all be so tired\nthey would fall asleep, snoring loudly.\nThe next day, while it was still dark,\nthey would all rise, my sisters preparing the meal and setting a tray for me.\nWhen everyone had eaten, they would again shoulder their quivers\nand depart. Again, in the evening,\nthey would return with weary faces, empty-handed,\nmy sisters preparing the meal, my brothers making arrows,\nalways doing the same things.\nOne day, again, my brothers and sisters\nshouldered their quivers and went out.\nI was carving treasures, but soon\nI rose from the platform, took a golden bow\nand golden arrows, and went outside.\nThe sea was vast and calm,\nwhales playing to the east and west,\nsplashing and frolicking. Then,\nto the east, my elder sisters, six in number, joined hands to form a ring,\nmy younger sisters, six in number, driving the whales into the ring.\nMy elder brothers, six in number, my younger brothers, six in number,\naimed and shot at the whales within the ring, their arrows\npassing beneath and above the whales.\nEvery day, they did this.\nI saw in the center of the sea\na large whale and its calf playing,\nleaping up and down. From afar,\nI nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow\nand aimed, piercing both the whale and its calf with a single shot.\nThen, I cut the whale in half\nand threw half into my sisters' ring.\nThen, with the remaining whale and a half,\nI placed it beneath its tail and headed towards the land of humans,\narriving at Otasutsu village.\nI pushed the whale and a half\nonto the village beach.\nThen, I slowly\nswam back across the sea,\nwhen someone came running beside me,\nout of breath.

Even though you have given them so much,\nthe lowly humans, the wicked humans,\ndo not appreciate it and do such things!\"\nSo I laughed and said,\n\"I have given it to the humans,\nso now it is theirs. Let the humans\ncut it with sickles or\nscrape it with axes, let them eat it as they please.\nWhat does it matter?\" The sea grebe seemed discomfited,\nbut I paid it no mind and slowly swam across the sea,\narriving at my sea as the day was ending.\nI saw\ntwelve brothers, twelve\nsisters, unable to carry the half whale,\nstruggling together, shouting loudly,\ngrumbling to the east of the sea.\nI was truly amazed.\nI ignored them and went home,\nsitting on the platform.\nThen, looking back towards the human world,\nI saw fine men and\nfine women surrounding the whale and a half I had beached,\ndressed in finery, rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty,\nand on the dunes behind,\na fine mat was spread,\nand upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,\nbound in six layers of kimono and sash, wearing six layers of kimono,\ncrowned with a magnificent god's crown, an ancestral crown,\na divine sword at his waist,\nlooking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high\nin prayer.

My sisters, though tired, would still prepare meals, setting the food before me,\nAnd after eating themselves, they would clean up,\nWhile my brothers busied themselves making bows and arrows.\nOnce the quivers were full, everyone, exhausted,\nWould fall asleep, their snores shaking the heavens.\nThe next day, before dawn,\nEveryone would rise, my sisters preparing meals, setting the food before me,\nAnd after eating, they would carry their quivers,\nAnd go out again. In the evening, they would\nReturn weary, their hands empty,\nMy sisters preparing meals, my brothers making bows and arrows,\nDay after day, year after year, always repeating the same things.\nOne day, my brothers and sisters again\nCarried their quivers and went out.\nI, who had been carving treasures, soon\nRose and stood upon the high platform, holding a golden bow\nAnd golden arrows, and went outside.\nLooking out, the sea was vast and calm,\nWhales frolicked in the east and west,\nPlaying and enjoying themselves. At that moment,\nIn the east, my eldest sister and six sisters held hands, forming a circle,\nWhile my younger sister and six sisters drove the whales into the circle,\nMy eldest brother and six brothers, my younger brother and six brothers,\nAimed their arrows at the whales within the circle, the arrows\nPassing beneath the whales, skimming above them.\nEvery day, they did this.\nI saw in the center of the sea,\nA giant whale and her child, rising and falling on the waves,\nPlaying and enjoying themselves,\nSo from afar, I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow,\nAimed, and shot, an arrow\nPiercing both the mother and child at once.\nThen, I cut one of the whales in half,\nThrowing half into my sisters' circle.\nAnd the other half of the whale,\nI placed tail-down and pushed it towards the land of humans,\nReaching the village of Otasutsu,\nAnd pushed that half-whale\nOnto the village's beach.\nAfter that, I leisurely\nSwam in the sea, returning,\nWhen I heard someone\nRunning breathlessly beside me,\nLooking closely, I saw it was a seagull.\nIt said, gasping for air:\n\"Tomin karikuru Kamui karikuru Iso yangke kuru\nBrave God, Great God,\nWhy would you bestow such abundant sea bounty upon lowly humans, wicked humans?\nLowly humans, wicked humans, are using axes\nAnd sickles to cut, stab,\nAnd scrape the great sea bounty! Brave God,\nGreat God, please take back\nThe sea bounty! You have given them so much,\nBut lowly humans, wicked humans,\nAre ungrateful and do such things!\"\nHearing this, I laughed and said:\n\"Now that I have given the sea bounty to humans,\nIt is theirs. Whether humans\nStab it with sickles or\nScrape it with axes, it is up to them,\nThey can eat it however they wish,\nWhat does it matter?\"\nThe seagull, hearing this, was somewhat bewildered,\nBut I paid it no mind, continuing to\nSwim leisurely in the sea,\nAs the sun began to set, I returned to my sea.\nThere,\nTwelve brothers, twelve\nSisters, were struggling to carry\nThat half-whale, exhausted, shouting together,\nStill slowly carrying it on the east side of the sea.\nI was speechless.\nI ignored them, returning directly\nHome, and sat upon the high platform.\nThen I looked back towards the human world,\nAnd saw that around the half-whale\nI had pushed onto the beach, were gathered\nWell-dressed men and\nWomen, celebrating the sea bounty with joy,\nOn the dunes behind,\nWere spread magnificent carpets,\nThe village chief of Otasutsu,\nWearing six kimonos, tightening his belt,\nWith a splendid crown of the gods, the crown of ancestors,\nA divine sword at his waist,\nIn a godlike, solemn, and beautiful pose, raised both hands,\nAnd offered prayers. The humans wept with joy,\nCelebrating the sea bounty.\nThe seagull said that humans\nWere stabbing the whale I pushed onto the beach with axes and sickles,\nBut in fact,\nThe village chief and\nThe villagers were taking out\nThe divine sword, considered the most precious treasure since ancient times,\nUsing it to cut the whale meat and carry it away.\nMoreover, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of\nReturning.\nTwo or three days passed, and I saw something\nNear the window, so I\nTurned to look, and saw on the window\nWas placed a golden cup filled with\nFine sake, with\nDecorated chopsticks laid across it,\nA messenger pacing back and forth, chanting:\n\"I am from the village of Otasutsu,\nThough it is presumptuous, I must offer this fine sake.\"\nThe village chief of Otasutsu, representing\nAll the villagers, expressed their gratitude in detail,\nSaying:\n\"Tomin karikuru Kamui karikuru Iso yangke kuru\nIf not for the Great God, the Brave God,\nWho would have had pity on our village, suffering from famine,\nHaving reached the end of our rope?\nYou have given our village life,\nWe are so grateful! We celebrate the sea bounty,\nAnd have made a little sake,\nAnd attached a small offering of inao,\nTo express our gratitude to the Great God.\"\nThe decorated chopsticks moved back and forth, stating this.\nSo I rose, took the\nGolden cup, raised it above my head,\nOpened the lids of the six sake barrels above my seat,\nAnd poured the fine sake little by little into the\nGolden cup, then placed the golden cup on the window.\nHaving done this, I sat on the high platform,\nAnd the golden cup and chopsticks had\nDisappeared. After that, I continued to carve scabbards,\nCarving scabbards, and unconsciously\nLooked up,\nAnd saw the room filled with beautiful inao,\nWhite clouds swirling within, white lightning\nFlashing. I thought it was truly beautiful.\nTwo or three days passed again,\nAnd then, I finally heard\nOutside the door, my brothers and\nSisters shouting loudly, pulling that whale back. I was very surprised.\nI watched them enter the house,\nAnd saw that my brothers and sisters\nWere very tired, their faces haggard.\nEveryone entered the house, saw so many inao,\nAnd repeatedly bowed in surprise.\nSoon, the six sake barrels on the east side\nOverflowed, and the fragrance of the gods' beloved\nSake filled the room.\nAfter that, I decorated the room with beautiful inao,\nInvited distant gods, neighboring gods,\nAnd held a grand banquet. My sisters\nCooked whale meat, offering it to the gods,\nWho praised it endlessly, very pleased.\nAs the banquet was in full swing, I rose,\nAnd explained in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,\nAnd how I had pity on them, pushing the sea bounty onto the beach,\nAnd how I had treated humans kindly, but was envied by evil gods,\nAnd how the seagull slandered me,\nAnd how the village chief of Otasutsu\nExpressed his gratitude in such and such words,\nAnd how the chopsticks decorated with inao came as messengers, and so on.\nThe gods listened,\nAnd unanimously nodded in agreement,\nPraising me.\nAfter that, I held another grand banquet,\nThe gods'\ndancing, singing,\nIntertwined into beautiful music, my sisters\nHolding pitchers, pouring sake at the tables,\nSome singing with the goddesses.\nTwo or three days passed, and the banquet ended.\nI gave two or three beautiful inao\nTo the gods, who bowed,\nRepeatedly, and\nReturned to their homes.\nAfter that, I was always with my eldest brother, six brothers,\nEldest sister, six sisters, younger sister, six sisters,\nYounger brother, six brothers,\nAnd every time humans brewed sake,\nThey would send me sake and inao.\nNow, humans no longer have to worry about a lack of food,\nLiving a peaceful\nLife, and I am at ease.",

    "comment": "## Analysis of the Two English Translations\n\n**Translation 1: Pros**\n*   **Literal Accuracy:** Translation 1 hews closely to the original Japanese sentence structure and word order, which can be beneficial for understanding the literal meaning.\n*   **Completeness:** It includes all the details present in the original text.\n\n**Translation 1: Cons**\n*   **Awkward Phrasing:** The close adherence to the original structure sometimes results in unnatural or awkward English phrasing.\n*   **Lack of Flow:** The translation can feel somewhat disjointed and lacks a smooth, poetic flow.\n\n**Translation 2: Pros**\n*   **Improved Flow:** Translation 2 takes liberties with sentence structure to create a more natural and readable English narrative.\n*   **Poetic Tone:** It attempts to capture the poetic essence of the original chant, using more evocative language.\n\n**Translation 2: Cons**\n*   **Omission of Details:** In its pursuit of flow, Translation 2 occasionally omits details present in the original Japanese text.\n*   **Interpretive Leaps:** There are instances where the translation seems to interpret rather than directly translate, potentially altering the original meaning.\n\n**Choice of Better Translation:**\n\nTranslation 1 is slightly better due to its higher accuracy in conveying the original meaning. While Translation 2 has a better flow, its occasional omissions and interpretive leaps make it less reliable as a translation.\n\n## Updated Translation Strategy\n\nThe updated translation will aim to combine the strengths of both versions:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** Prioritize the accurate conveyance of the original Japanese meaning, using Translation 1 as the base.\n*   **Flow:** Incorporate the improved sentence structure and phrasing from Translation 2 to enhance readability.\n*   **Poetic Tone:** Use more evocative language where appropriate to capture the poetic essence of the chant, while ensuring accuracy.\n*   **Clarity:** Use modern and simple English for easy understanding.\n*   **Cultural Sensitivity:** Retain original terms like \"Kamuy\", \"Nusa\", and \"Inao\" where direct translation is impossible or would diminish the cultural significance.\n",
