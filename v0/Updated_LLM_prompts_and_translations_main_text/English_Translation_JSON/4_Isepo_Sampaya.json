    "english_translation_1": "The Song of the Rabbit: \"Sanpaya Tereke\"\n\nAcross two valleys, across three, I hopped and skipped,\nfollowing my elder brother to the mountains in playful glee.\nEach day I trailed behind, only to find\nhumans had set a crossbow trap, which my brother would unwind.\nI'd laugh at the sight, a common delight.\nBut one day, oh, what a fright!\nUnexpectedly, my brother was caught in the snare,\ncrying out in utter despair.\n\nStartled, I rushed to his side with a leap,\nHe spoke through tears, his voice so deep:\n\"Dear brother, run with haste, don't delay,\nGo to our village and loudly say,\n'Your brother is caught in a crossbow's hold!' – cry out, 'Hoh ho-hoy!' be bold.\"\n\nI listened close, \"Yes, yes,\" I replied,\nThen bounded away, my playful spirit my guide.\nAcross two valleys, across three, I flew,\nArriving at our village, the task I must do.\n\nBut then it struck me, the message I bore,\nWhat my brother had said, I couldn't recall anymore.\nI stood there, blank, trying to seize\nthe words he entrusted, but found no ease.\n\nSo back I went, with leaps reversed,\nAcross three valleys, my heart immersed\nin worry and dread. I reached the place,\nBut my brother was gone, leaving not a trace.\nOnly his blood stained the ground,\na silent testament to what was found.\n\n(Here the story takes a turn, a different tale to burn)\n\nKetoka woi woi Ketoka, Ketoka woi Ketoka\nDay after day, I'd venture to the mountain's peak,\ndestroying human crossbows, a mischievous streak.\nI found such joy in this playful game,\nUntil one day, things wouldn't be the same.\n\nAt the usual spot, a crossbow stood,\nBut beside it, a tiny one, made of yomogi wood.\nI gazed at it, with curious eyes,\n\"What's this for?\" I wondered with surprise.\nAmused, I touched it, then tried to flee,\nBut unexpectedly, it ensnared me!\n\nThe more I struggled, the tighter it grew,\nHelpless, I cried, not knowing what to do.\nThen something flew near, a welcome sight,\nIt was my brother, bathed in golden light!\nI rejoiced, and bid him to tell our kin\nOf my plight, trapped within.\n\nBut time passed, and no one came,\nI wept alone, consumed by shame.\nThen a shadow appeared, a figure so grand,\nA beautiful human youth, like a god in the land.\nSmiling, he seized me, and carried me away,\nTo a grand house, filled with treasures on display.\n\nHe lit a fire, and placed a pot above,\nThen drew a knife, showing little love.\nHe chopped my body, skin and all,\nFilling the pot, answering darkness' call.\nThen, headfirst, he shoved me down below,\nstoking the flames, watching the fire glow.\n\nI yearned to escape, to find a way,\nWatching the youth, hoping for disarray.\n\"If I boil and die, a pointless end,\nA wretched death, my spirit can't mend!\"\n\nSo I waited, watching for a chance,\nTo turn myself into a piece of meat, a fleeting trance.\nI mingled with the steam, rising high,\nThen leaped to the pot's edge, beneath the sky.\nI jumped to the left, then bolted outside,\nFleeing in tears, with nowhere to hide.\n\nI ran to my home, breathless and weak,\nRelieved to be safe, no longer meek.\nLooking back, I realized with a start,\nThe human youth, so kind at heart,\nWas none other than Okikirmui, a god of might,\nWhose power I'd challenged, with foolish delight.\n\nHe was angered by my daily pranks,\nAnd sought to kill me with yomogi shanks.\nBut I, too, am a god, though of lesser renown,\nAnd a pointless death would bring my kin down.\nHe pitied their plight, their sorrow and pain,\nAnd allowed me to flee, escaping his reign.\n\nFrom that day on, the rabbit's form,\nonce as large as a deer, weathering every storm,\nshrank to the size of Okikirmui's meat,\na consequence of mischief, bitter and sweet.\nOur descendants will all be this small,\nA reminder to heed the lesson's call.\n\n\"Rabbits of the future, never play pranks,\nOr face the wrath of the divine ranks!\"\nSo spoke the rabbit chief, before his last breath,\nA warning against folly, a lesson in death.",

    "comment": "After a thorough comparison, Translation 2 is more accurate to the original Japanese text, especially in conveying the nuances of the Ainu chant. It maintains a closer structure to the original, making it easier to trace the meaning. However, it lacks the poetic flow and storytelling quality present in Translation 1. Translation 1 takes more liberty with the text, adding a layer of poetic interpretation that, while beautiful, sometimes veers from the literal meaning. For example, Translation 1 added the line \"Whose power I'd challenged, with foolish delight\", which is not a direct translation of the original text. Translation 2 is more literal, but less engaging. Therefore, I will use Translation 2 as the base and incorporate the poetic elements from Translation 1 to create a final, improved translation.\n\nPros of Translation 1:\n*   Poetic and engaging storytelling.\n*   Smooth and natural English flow.\n*   Effective use of imagery and emotion.\n\nCons of Translation 1:\n*   Less literal, with added interpretations.\n*   Some phrases deviate from the original meaning.\n*   Can be less precise in conveying specific details.\n\nPros of Translation 2:\n*   More accurate and literal translation.\n*   Closer adherence to the original structure.\n*   Preserves specific cultural terms like \"yomogi\".\n\nCons of Translation 2:\n*   Less poetic and less engaging.\n*   Can sound somewhat stiff or awkward in English.\n*   Lacks the storytelling flair of Translation 1.",
