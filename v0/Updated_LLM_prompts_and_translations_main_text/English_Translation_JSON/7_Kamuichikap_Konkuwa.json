    "english_translation_1": "The Owl God's Own Song: \"Konkwa\"\n\n\"Konkwa,\nIn the old days, when I spoke, it was like the sound of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark,\nResonating from the center of the *kyuha* (bow grip),\nBut now, alas, I am weakened and old.\nYet, if there were someone eloquent,\nConfident as a messenger,\nI would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven.\"\n\nSo I spoke, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* (lacquered box) with *tagatsuki* (metal fittings),\nWhen someone at the entrance said,\n\"Who but I is so eloquent and confident as a messenger?\"\nAnd when I looked, it was a young crow.\nI let him into the house, and then, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\nTo appoint the young crow as my messenger,\nI explained the negotiation for three days,\nBut as I spoke of the third point, I saw\nThe young crow dozing behind the hearth.\nSeeing this, I was enraged,\nAnd I struck the young crow with all my feathers and killed him.\n\nThen again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\n\"If there is anyone confident as a messenger,\nI would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven.\"\nThen someone again at the entrance said,\n\"Who but I is so eloquent\nAs to stand as a messenger to Heaven?\"\nAnd when I looked, it was a jay from the mountains.\n\nI let him into the house, and then again,\nTapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\nI spoke of the negotiation of five and a half *yo*,\nAnd after four days, as I spoke of the fourth point,\nThe mountain jay was dozing behind the hearth.\nI was furious and struck the mountain jay with all my feathers\nAnd killed him.\n\nThen again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\n\"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,\nI would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven.\"\nThen someone entered with\nA respectful demeanor, and when I looked,\nIt was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance,\nWho sat on the left side. And so I,\nTapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,\nContinued to speak of the five and a half points,\nNight and day. And when I looked,\nThe young river crow showed no sign of fatigue,\nListening, and counting the days and nights,\nOn the sixth day, as soon as I finished speaking,\nHe went straight out through the skylight\nAnd departed for Heaven.\n\nThe gist of the negotiation was this: in the human world,\nThere was a famine, and the humans were on the verge\nOf starvation. When I investigated the reason,\nI found that the gods in Heaven\nWho controlled the deer and the fish\nHad consulted and decided to withhold both deer and fish.\nNo matter what was said to them, they turned a deaf ear,\nSo when the humans went to the mountains to hunt,\nThere were no deer, and when they went to the rivers\nTo fish, there were no fish.\nI was angered by this, so\nI appointed a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.\n\nAfter many days had passed,\nA faint sound could be heard in the sky,\nAnd someone entered. When I looked,\nIt was the young river crow, now even more beautiful\nAnd possessing a valiant dignity,\nWho began to deliver the counter-negotiation.\n\nThe reason the deer god and the fish god in Heaven\nHad withheld the deer and the fish until today\nWas that when the humans caught deer,\nThey struck the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,\nThey left the deer's head as it was in the mountain *kihara* (field),\nAnd when they caught fish,\nThey killed them by striking their heads with rotten wood.\nSo the deer, naked and weeping,\nReturned to the deer god, and the fish\nReturned to the fish god, carrying the rotten wood in their mouths.\nThe deer god and the fish god were\nAngry and consulted, and withheld the deer\nAnd the fish. But if from now on\nThe humans treat both deer and fish\nWith care, then they will release the deer\nAnd release the fish, so the deer god and\nThe fish god said, he reported in detail.\n\nAfter hearing this, I offered praise to the young river crow,\nAnd saw that indeed\nThe humans had treated the deer and fish\nCarelessly. From then on,\nI taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,\nNever to do such things again, and the humans\nRealized their wrongdoings, and from then on,\nThey made beautiful fishing tools like *nusa* (sacred wands),\nAnd used them to catch fish. When they caught deer, they also\nDecorated the deer's head beautifully and offered it in sacrifice.\nSo the fish rejoiced and carried the beautiful *gohei* (paper streamers)\nTo the fish god, and the deer\nRejoiced and returned to the deer god,\nWith newly shaved *sakayaki* (hair on the head).\nThe deer god and\nThe fish god were pleased and\nReleased many fish and many deer.\nThe humans now live without any hardship\nOr hunger,\nAnd I was relieved to see this.\n\nI am now old, weakened, and frail,\nAnd I was thinking of going to Heaven,\nBut because there was a famine in the human land that I protect,\nAnd the humans were on the verge of starvation, I could not\nGo without concern, so\nI have remained until now, but now that there is\nNothing to worry about, I will place the strongest,\nA young hero, in my place to protect the human world,\nAnd now I am going to Heaven.\"\n\nSo spoke the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the land,\nAnd departed for Heaven. So it is told.",

    "comment": "Translation 2 is better because it uses more vivid and descriptive language, creating a more engaging and poetic narrative. It also maintains a good balance between accuracy and readability. Translation 1 is more literal and lacks the storytelling quality present in Translation 2. However, Translation 1 includes some useful cultural context (e.g., explaining 'kyuha', 'shintoko', 'tagatsuki', and 'nusa'), which enhances understanding. I will incorporate these explanations into the new translation while maintaining the poetic tone of Translation 2.",
