序

その昔この広い北海道は,私たちの先祖の自由の天地でありました.天真爛漫な稚児の様に,美しい大自然に抱擁されてのんびりと楽しく生活していた彼等は,真に自然の寵児,なんという幸福な人だちであったでしょう.
冬の陸には林野をおおう深雪を蹴って,天地を凍らす寒気を物ともせず山又山をふみ越えて熊を狩り,夏の海には涼風泳ぐみどりの波,白い鴎の歌を友に木の葉の様な小舟を浮べてひねもす魚を漁り,花咲く春は軟らかな陽の光を浴びて,永久に囀さえずる小鳥と共に歌い暮して蕗ふきとり蓬よもぎ摘み,紅葉の秋は野分に穂揃うすすきをわけて,宵まで鮭とる篝かがりも消え,谷間に友呼ぶ鹿の音を外に,円まどかな月に夢を結ぶ.嗚呼なんという楽しい生活でしょう.平和の境,それも今は昔,夢は破れて幾十年,この地は急速な変転をなし,山野は村に,村は町にと次第々々に開けてゆく.
太古ながらの自然の姿も何時の間にか影薄れて,野辺に山辺に嬉々として暮していた多くの民の行方も亦いずこ.僅かに残る私たち同族は,進みゆく世のさまにただ驚きの眼をみはるばかり.しかもその眼からは一挙一動宗教的感念に支配されていた昔の人の美しい魂の輝きは失われて,不安に充ち不平に燃え,鈍りくらんで行手も見わかず,よその御慈悲にすがらねばならぬ,あさましい姿,おお亡びゆくもの......それは今の私たちの名,なんという悲しい名前を私たちは持っているのでしょう.
その昔,幸福な私たちの先祖は,自分のこの郷土が末にこうした惨めなありさまに変ろうなどとは,露ほども想像し得なかったのでありましょう.
時は絶えず流れる,世は限りなく進展してゆく.激しい競争場裡に敗残の醜をさらしている今の私たちの中からも,いつかは,二人三人でも強いものが出て来たら,進みゆく世と歩をならべる日も,やがては来ましょう.それはほんとうに私たちの切なる望み,明暮あけくれ祈っている事で御座います.
けれど......愛する私たちの先祖が起伏す日頃互いに意を通ずる為に用いた多くの言語,言い古し,残し伝えた多くの美しい言葉,それらのものもみんな果敢なく,亡びゆく弱きものと共に消失せてしまうのでしょうか.おおそれはあまりにいたましい名残惜しい事で御座います.
アイヌに生れアイヌ語の中に生いたった私は,雨の宵,雪の夜,暇ある毎に打集って私たちの先祖が語り興じたいろいろな物語の中極く小さな話の一つ二つを拙ない筆に書連ねました.
私たちを知って下さる多くの方に読んでいただく事が出来ますならば,私は,私たちの同族祖先と共にほんとうに無限の喜び,無上の幸福に存じます.

## Preface

Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was the realm of freedom for our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. Truly, they were nature's darlings, such blessed people they were.

In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the forests, braving the freezing air that chilled the earth, crossing mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they sailed their leaf-like boats on the green waves where cool breezes swam, the songs of white gulls their companions, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending their days singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the crimson autumn, they parted the fields of pampas grass, whose ears swayed in the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon faded into the evening. With the calls of deer echoing through the valleys, they dreamt beneath the round moon. Ah, what a joyous life!

That peaceful world is now a thing of the past. Decades have passed since those dreams were shattered. This land has undergone rapid transformation, with mountains and fields gradually giving way to villages, and villages to towns.

Before we knew it, the ancient face of nature has faded, and where have all the people who once lived joyfully in the fields and mountains gone? The few of our kin who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Yet, the beautiful souls of those ancient people, whose every action was governed by religious sentiment, are now gone from their eyes, replaced by anxiety and resentment, dulled and clouded, unable to see the way forward. They must rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now. What a sorrowful name we bear.

In the past, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state.

Time flows ceaselessly, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of the defeated in this fierce arena of competition, perhaps someday two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our ardent hope, and we pray for it morning and night.

But... will all the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other daily, the ancient and beautiful words they passed down, all disappear along with the perishing weak? Oh, that is too heartbreaking and regrettable.

Born an Ainu and raised within the Ainu language, I have written down in clumsy prose one or two of the very small stories from the many tales our ancestors used to gather and enjoy on rainy evenings and snowy nights whenever I had some free time.

If many who know us can read this, I, along with our ancestors, will truly feel boundless joy and supreme happiness.

Prologue

Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. They were truly the darlings of nature, such fortunate people!

In winter, they kicked away the thick snow covering the forests, braving the freezing cold to hunt bears across mountains and fields. In summer, accompanied by the songs of white gulls on the breezy, green-waved sea, they floated on leaf-like canoes, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they basked in the gentle sunlight, celebrating with the ever-singing birds, picking Fuki (蜂斗菜) and mugwort. In the autumn of fiery red leaves, they parted the wind-blown, neatly aligned Susuki (芒草), and until the bonfires for salmon fishing died out late at night, they dreamed under the bright moon, accompanied by the deer's calls in the valleys. Ah, what a joyful life! That peaceful state is now a thing of the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone drastic changes, with mountains and fields becoming villages, and villages becoming towns, gradually being developed.

The natural scenery of ancient times has gradually disappeared, and where have the many people who once lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? We, the few remaining of our people, can only stare in astonishment at the ever-advancing world. Moreover, the light of the beautiful souls, once governed by religious beliefs in every action, has vanished from those eyes, filled with anxiety and dissatisfaction, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others. What a pitiful sight! Ah, things on the verge of extinction... that is our current name, what a sad name we bear!

Long ago, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would eventually become so miserable.

Time flows on, and the world develops infinitely. In the fierce arena of competition, even as we now expose the ugly sight of defeat, someday, if two or three strong individuals emerge to walk alongside the ever-advancing era, that day will surely come. That is truly our fervent wish, the thing we pray for day and night.

But... our beloved ancestors, the many languages they used to communicate with each other in daily life, will all those beautiful words, worn out and left behind, also disappear mercilessly along with the weak who are about to perish? Ah, what a painful and regrettable thing that would be!

As an Ainu, raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights and snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather together and record, with clumsy strokes, a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors.

If these words can be read by the many who understand us, I will, together with our Ainu ancestors, feel immense joy and supreme happiness.

## Analysis of the Two Translations:

**Translation 1: Pros**
*   Flows well and reads naturally in English.
*   Uses vivid language and imagery.
*   Captures the overall tone and sentiment of the original text.

**Translation 1: Cons**
*   Some minor inaccuracies in translating specific details (e.g., the description of autumn).
*   Could benefit from including some of the original Japanese terms for cultural elements to preserve authenticity.

**Translation 2: Pros**
*   More literal and accurate in translating specific details and cultural references.
*   Includes original Japanese terms (Fuki, Susuki) which adds authenticity.

**Translation 2: Cons**
*   The English is slightly less natural and fluid compared to Translation 1.
*   Some sentences are a bit clunky and could be phrased more elegantly.

**Choice of Better Translation:**

Translation 2 is slightly better because accuracy is the most important criterion. It includes more specific details and cultural references from the original text. However, it needs improvement in terms of fluency and naturalness.

## Updated Translation Strategy:

The updated translation will be based on Translation 2, incorporating the strengths of Translation 1 to improve readability and flow. The goal is to maintain accuracy while making the English more natural and engaging. I will keep the original Japanese terms where appropriate and provide explanations if necessary.
