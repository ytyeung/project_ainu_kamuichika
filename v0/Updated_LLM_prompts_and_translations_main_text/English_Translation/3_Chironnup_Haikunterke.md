狐が自ら歌った謡
「ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ」

ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ
国の岬,神の岬の上に
私は坐して居りました.
ある日に外へ出て見ますと
海は凪なぎてひろびろとしていて,海の上に
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカとサマユンクルが
海猟に三人乗りで出かけています,それを見た私は
私の持ってる悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上をずーっと上へずーっと下へ
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけ出しました.
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパーウ,パウと叫び
この川の水源をにらみにらみ暴風の魔を
呼びました.すると,それにつれてこの川の
水源から烈しい風,つむじ風が
吹き出して海にはいると直ぐに
この海は,上の海が下になり
下の海が上になりました.オキキリムイたち
の漁舟は沖の人の海と,陸の人の海との
出会ったところ(海の中程)に,非常な急変に会って波の間を
クルリと廻りました.大きな浪が山の様に
舟の上へかぶさり寄ります.すると,
オキキリムイ,サマユンクル,シュプンラムカは
声をふるって,舟を漕ぎました.
この小さい舟は落葉の飛ぶ様に吹き飛ばされ
今にもくつがえりそうになるけれども
感心にも人間たちは力強くて
この小舟は風の中に
波の上をすべります.
それを見ると私の持っている悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり,
重い調子で木片がポキリポキリと折れる様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔を声援するのみに精を出しました.
そうしてる中に,やっと,サマユンクルが
手の上から,手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれました.
そのさまを見て私はひそかに笑いを浮べました.
それからまた,精を出して
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
暴風の魔を声援しました.
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカと二人で
励まし合いながら勇ましく舟を漕いで
居りましたが,と,ある時シュプンラムカは
手の上から手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれてしまいました,それを見て
ひそかに私は笑いました.
それからまた軽い足取りで腰やわらかに
飛びまわり重い調子でかたい木片を
ポキリポキリと折る様に叫び精を出しました.
けれども,オキキリムイは疲れた様子は少しも無い.
一枚の薄物を体にまとい,
舟を漕いでいます,そのうちに
手の下でその持っていた楫、が折れてしまいました.
すると,疲れ死んだサマユンクルに
躍りかかりその持っている楫、をもぎとってたった一人で
舟を漕ぎました.
私はそれを見ると,持前の悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
重い調子でかたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
精を出して暴風の魔に声援しました.
そうしてるうちにサマユンクルの舵も
折れてしまいました.オキキリムイはシュプンラムカに
躍りかかりその楫をとって
勇ましく舟を漕ぎました.
けれども彼の楫も波に折られてしまいました.
そこで,オキキリムイは舟の中に
立ちつくして,烈しい風のうちに
まさか人間の彼が私を見つけようとは
思わなかったに,国の岬,神の岬の
上の,私の眼の央を見つめました.
今までやさしかった顔に怒りの色を
あらわして,鞄をいじっていたが
中から出したものを見ると,蓬よもぎの小弓と
蓬の小矢を取り出しました.
それを見てひそかに私は笑いました.
「人間なぞ何をしたって,恐い事があるものか,
あんな蓬の小矢は何に使うものだろう.」
と思ってこの岬
国の岬,神の岬の上を
ずーっと上へずーっと下へ軽い足取りで
腰やわらかにかけまわり,重い調子で
かたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔をほめたたえました.
その中にオキキリムイの射放した矢が飛んで来ましたが
ちょうど私の襟首えりくびのところへ突きささりました.
それっきりあとどうなったか解らなくなってしまいました.
ふと気がついて見ると
大そう好いお天気で,海の上は
広々として,オキキリムイの漁舟もなにもありません.
どうした事か私の頭のさきから
足のさきまで雁皮が燃え縮む様に痛みます.
まさか人間の射た小さな矢がこんなに私を苦しめ
ようとは思わなかったのに,それから手足をもがき苦しみ
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上を,ずーっと上へ,ずーっと下へ泣き叫びながら
もがき苦しみ,昼でも夜でも生きたり
死んだり,している中に,どうしたか
わからなくなりました.
ふと気がついて見ると,
大きな黒狐の耳と耳との間に私は居りました.
二日ほどたった時,オキキリムイが神様の様な様子で
やって来て,ニコニコ笑って言うことには,
「まあ見ばのよい事,国の岬,神の岬
の上を見守る黒狐の神様は,
善い心,神の心を持っていたから
死にざまの見ばのよい死方をしたのですね.」
言いながら私の頭を取って,
自分の家へ持って行き私の上顎の骨を
自分の便所のどだいとし,私の下顎を
その妻の便所の礎として,
私のからだはそのまま土と共に腐ってしまいました.
それから夜でも昼でも
悪い臭気に苦しんでいる中に私はつまらない死方,悪い
死方をしました.
ただの身分の軽い神でもなかったのですが
大変な悪い心を私は持っていた為なんにも
ならない,悪い死方を私はしたのですから
これからの狐たちよ,決して
悪い心を持ちなさるな.

と狐の神様が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
The Fox's Own Song:
"Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat in my place.
One day, I ventured out and saw,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur
Set out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this,
The wicked thoughts within me stirred.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with light steps,
I ran, my waist swaying gently.
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood,
I cried, "Pau, pau!" and glared at the source of the river,
Summoning the demon of the storm. Then, from the river's
source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Erupted and entered the sea, and at once,
The upper sea became the lower, and
The lower sea became the upper. Okikirmui and the others'
fishing boat, at the meeting place of the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land,
Met with a sudden change and spun amidst the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed over the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown like a falling leaf,
On the verge of capsizing, but
Admirable were the humans, strong and resilient,
And the small boat glided through the wind,
Over the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
Devoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, at last, Samayunkur's
hands bled from above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I devoted myself,
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,
Cheering on the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka, the two of them,
Encouraged each other and bravely rowed the boat,
But then, at one moment, Shupunramka's
hands bled from above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps, I leaped, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, devoting myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a single thin garment wrapped around his body,
He rowed the boat, until
The oar he held broke in his hands.
Then, he leaped upon the exhausted Samayunkur,
Snatched the oar he held, and rowed the boat alone.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
Devoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, Samayunkur's rudder also
broke. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramka,
Took his oar, and
Bravely rowed the boat.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the fierce wind,
Never imagining that a human like him could find me,
He gazed at the center of my eyes,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His gentle face now filled with anger,
He fiddled with his bag,
And from within, he took out a small mugwort bow and
A small mugwort arrow.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
"What can a human do to frighten me?
What use is such a mugwort arrow?"
Thinking this, upon this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with light steps,
I ran, my waist swaying gently, with a heavy tone,
Like snapping wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
Praising the demon of the storm.
In the midst of this, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew and
Pierced me right at the collar of my neck.
After that, I lost all sense of what happened.
When I came to, I found
The weather was wonderfully fine, and the sea was
Vast, with no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it ached as if the bark of a tree was burning and shrinking.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so,
Then, writhing in agony, I struggled,
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, crying and screaming,
Writhing in agony, living and
Dying, day and night, until I lost
All sense of what had happened.
When I came to, I found myself
Between the ears of a great black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui arrived, looking like a god,
Smiling and saying,
"How beautiful! The black fox god who watches over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Had a good heart, a godly heart,
And so died a beautiful death."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the foundation of his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
Then, day and night,
Suffering from the foul stench, I died a meaningless, bad
death.
Though I was not merely a god of low rank,
Because I possessed a terribly wicked heart, I died a useless,
bad death. Therefore,
Foxes of the future, never
Hold wicked thoughts."

So the fox god told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
The Song of the Fox, Sung by Himself
"Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori
Upon the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I sat in my place.
One day, I stepped outside,
And saw the sea, serene and vast. Upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunkamuka, and Samayunkuru
Sailed out to hunt. Seeing this,
A wicked thought arose within me.
On this cape, the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran lightly, with a supple waist.
In a heavy voice, like splintering wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
I glared at the river's source, summoning the magic of the storm.
And then it came, from the river's
source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
That rushed upon the sea, and at once
the sea churned, upside down. Okikirmui and his companions'
Fishing boat, at the meeting place of those from the near shore and the far (the sea's center),
Met with sudden change, spinning in the waves.
Great waves, like mountains,
Covered the boat. And so,
Okikirmui, Samayunkuru, Shupunkamuka
Cried out in desperation, rowing with all their might.
The small boat was tossed like a fallen leaf,
On the verge of capsizing.
Yet, admirable were these men, full of strength,
As the small boat sailed on the wind,
Upon the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked thought arose in me again.
I ran lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like splintering wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
Striving with all my power to aid the storm's magic.
And as I did, at last, Samayunkuru's
hands, his arms, ran with blood,
And he collapsed in exhaustion.
Seeing this, I chuckled to myself.
Then, I strained with all my might,
Running lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like splintering wood, I cried,
To aid the storm's magic.
Okikirmui and Shupunkamuka encouraged each other,
Rowing bravely on, when suddenly,
Shupunkamuka's
hands, his arms, ran with blood,
And he collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I chuckled to myself.
Then, I leaped and ran lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like the cracking of hard wood,
Straining with all my power.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of weariness.
He wore only a thin garment,
And rowed on, until,
The oar in his hands, it broke.
And so, he lunged at the exhausted and fallen Samayunkuru,
Seized the oar from his hands, and alone,
He rowed on.
Seeing this, the wicked thought arose in me again.
In a heavy voice, like the cracking of hard wood, I cried,
Running lightly, with a supple waist,
Striving with all my power to aid the storm's magic.
And as I did, Samayunkuru's rudder,
It broke. Okikirmui lunged at Shupunkamuka,
Seized his oar,
And rowed on bravely.
But his oar, too, was broken by the waves.
And so, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, in the raging wind,
Never imagining that a human like him would see me,
He gazed at the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
And into my eyes.
His gentle face turned to anger,
And he rummaged in his bag,
And from it, he took a small bow of mugwort,
And a small arrow of mugwort.
Seeing this, I chuckled to myself.
"What can a human do? What is there to fear?
What use is such a small arrow of mugwort?"
I thought, and on this cape,
The Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran up and down, lightly,
With a supple waist, in a heavy voice,
Like the cracking of hard wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
Praising the storm's magic.
And then, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
And struck me right in the collar.
From then on, I knew nothing more.
When I came to my senses,
The weather was fair, and the sea
Was vast and serene. Okikirmui's fishing boat was gone.
What had happened? From the top of my head
To the tips of my toes, I ached as if scorched.
Never had I imagined that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so. And so I struggled,
On this cape, the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran up and down, crying out,
Struggling, day and night, sometimes living,
Sometimes dying. And as I did, I knew not
What had happened.
When I came to my senses,
I was between the ears of a great black fox.
About two days later, Okikirmui came as a divine spirit,
Smiling, and said,
"How beautiful! The black fox god, guarding the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
Because he possessed a kind heart, a divine heart,
He died so honorably."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it back to his home, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the cornerstone of his wife's toilet.
My body, as it was, rotted with the earth.
From then on, day and night,
I suffered the torment of foul odors. I died without worth, I died miserably.
I was not merely a low-ranking god,
But because I harbored an extremely wicked heart, I was worthless.
I died miserably.
And so, from now on, you foxes, never,
Never harbor a wicked heart.

Thus spoke the fox god.

The Fox God's Lament:
"Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori,
Upon the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I sat in my dominion.
One day, I ventured forth,
And beheld the sea, serene and vast. Upon its face,
Okikirmui, Shupunkamuka, and Samayunkuru
Sailed out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this sight,
A wicked thought stirred within me.

On this cape, this Cape of the Land, this Cape of the Gods,
I ran with light steps and a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like wood splintering, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
I glared at the river's source, summoning the storm's dark magic.
Then it arose, from the river's
source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind's wrath,
Rushing upon the sea, and at once
the sea churned, the upper depths became the lower, and
the lower rose above. Okikirmui and his companions'
fishing boat, at the meeting place of the near shore and the horizon's edge (the sea's heart),
Met with sudden chaos, spinning amidst the towering waves.
Great waves, like mountains rising,
Crashed over their fragile vessel. And so,
Okikirmui, Samayunkuru, Shupunkamuka
Cried out in desperation, rowing with all their might against the tempest.

The small boat was tossed like a fallen leaf in autumn's gale,
On the very edge of capsizing.
Yet, admirable were these humans, full of strength and resilience,
As the small boat glided on the wind's breath,
Upon the raging waves.

Seeing this, the wicked thought stirred within me once more.
I ran lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like wood splintering, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
Devoting myself to cheering on the storm's dark magic.

And as I did, at last, Samayunkuru's
hands, his arms, ran crimson with blood,
And he collapsed, utterly exhausted.
Seeing this, I chuckled to myself in secret delight.

Then, I strained with all my might,
Running lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like wood splintering, I cried,
To aid the storm's dark magic.

Okikirmui and Shupunkamuka encouraged each other with valiant cries,
Rowing bravely onward, when suddenly,
Shupunkamuka's
hands, his arms, ran crimson with blood,
And he collapsed, utterly exhausted. Seeing this,
I chuckled to myself in secret delight.

Then, I leaped and ran lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like the cracking of hard wood,
Straining with all my power.

But Okikirmui showed no sign of weariness, his spirit unyielding.
He wore only a single thin garment,
And rowed on, until,
The oar in his hands, it shattered and broke.

And so, he lunged at the exhausted and fallen Samayunkuru,
Seized the oar from his grasp, and alone,
He rowed onward.

Seeing this, the wicked thought stirred within me once more.
In a heavy voice, like the cracking of hard wood, I cried,
Running lightly, with a supple waist,
Devoting myself to cheering on the storm's dark magic.

And as I did, Samayunkuru's rudder,
It broke and was lost to the waves. Okikirmui lunged at Shupunkamuka,
Seized his oar,
And rowed on bravely.
But his oar, too, was broken by the relentless waves.

Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the fierce and raging wind,
Never imagining that a mere human could perceive me,
He gazed at the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
And directly into my very eyes.
His gentle face turned to a mask of anger,
And he rummaged within his bag,
And from it, he drew a small bow of mugwort,
And a small arrow of mugwort.
Seeing this, I chuckled to myself in secret.

"What can a human do to frighten a god? What is there to fear?
What use is such a small arrow of mugwort?"
I thought, and upon this cape,
The Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran up and down, lightly,
With a supple waist, in a heavy voice,
Like the cracking of hard wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
Praising the storm's dark magic.

And then, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew with deadly aim,
And pierced me right at the collar of my neck.
From then on, I knew nothing more, my senses lost to the void.

When I came to my senses, the world was changed,
The weather was fair, and the sea
Was vast and serene. Okikirmui's fishing boat was gone, vanished without a trace.
What had happened? From the top of my head
To the tips of my toes, I ached as if my very essence was scorched and consumed.
Never had I imagined that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so.
And so I struggled, writhing in agony,
On this cape, the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran up and down, crying out in despair,
Struggling, day and night, sometimes living,
Sometimes dying. And as I did, I knew not
What had befallen me.

When I came to my senses once more,
I was trapped between the ears of a great black fox.
About two days later, Okikirmui arrived, appearing as a divine spirit,
Smiling, and said,
"How beautiful! The black fox god, guardian of the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
Because he possessed a kind heart, a divine heart,
He died so honorably, a death befitting a god."

Saying this, he took my severed head,
Brought it back to his home, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the cornerstone of his wife's toilet.
My body, as it was, rotted away with the earth, returning to the dust.

From then on, day and night,
I suffered the torment of foul odors, a prisoner of stench. I died without worth, I died a miserable death.
I was not merely a low-ranking god, a spirit of little consequence,
But because I harbored an extremely wicked heart, I was worthless.
I died a miserable death, a fate deserved.

And so, from now on, you foxes, never,
Never harbor a wicked heart, lest you meet a similar end."

Thus spoke the fox god, lamenting his fate.

Translation 1 Pros:
*   More literal translation, preserving the original structure and phrasing.
*   Clearer in some descriptions, such as the initial setting and the actions of the fox god.

Translation 1 Cons:
*   Can feel a bit clunky and less poetic in certain areas.
*   Some phrases are less natural in modern English.

Translation 2 Pros:
*   More poetic and flows better in English.
*   Uses more evocative language and imagery.
*   More concise and easier to read.

Translation 2 Cons:
*   Sometimes takes liberties with the literal meaning for the sake of flow.
*   Some details are omitted or simplified.

Choice of Better Translation: Translation 2 is slightly better due to its superior flow and readability, which makes it more engaging for a modern audience. However, it sacrifices some accuracy. Therefore, the new translation will aim to incorporate the accuracy of Translation 1 with the poetic flow of Translation 2.
