沼澤的魔神親自吟唱的歌謠「Harits Kunna」

Harits Kunna
某日，天氣晴朗
我從我的沼澤裡，只露出眼睛和嘴巴
向外窺探
遠遠地，從海邊傳來人們的談話聲。
看見兩個年輕人結伴而來。
走在前面的人，看來像個勇者，具備勇者的氣度
像神一般俊美
但看走在後面的人，面容憔悴
氣色不佳，他們一邊交談一邊走著
經過我的沼澤邊
正好走到我的面前，後面那個面色不好的男人
停下腳步，摀住自己的鼻子
「喔，好臭，真討厭的沼澤，經過這糟糕的沼澤
真是骯髒，這是什麼味道，這麼臭。」
我只是聽著，卻感到怒火中燒，幾乎忘了自己的存在。
我從泥沼中跳了出來。我一躍而起
大地裂開，地面崩塌。我發出獠牙的
怒吼，猛烈地追趕他們
走在前面的那個人，一見情況不妙
像魚兒般靈巧地轉身，從面色不好的男人的
腋下鑽過，迅速逃走了。
我追趕那個青面男子兩三步
立刻追上，一口將他吞下。
然後，我用盡全力追趕先前逃走的
來到人類的村莊，一個很大的村莊。
看見從那邊走來
火之老嫗，神之老嫗，身穿紅色衣裳，六層衣裳
束著腰帶，披著六層衣裳
拄著紅色的杖，向我飛奔而來。
「喂喂，你是來我們阿伊努村做什麼的
快回去，快回去。」
她一邊說著，一邊舉起紅色的杖，金色的杖，向我
打來，杖上燃燒的火焰
像雨點般落在我身上。
但我絲毫不為所動
一邊發出獠牙的怒吼，一邊追趕
那個男人，那個男人在村子裡
像轉動的圓環般奔跑。我緊追不捨
大地裂開，地面崩塌。整個村莊一片混亂
有人拉著妻子的手，有人拉著孩子的手，哭喊著
逃離，一片沸騰。
但我毫不在意，捲起漫天塵土
火之老女神跑到我的身邊
巨大的火焰，在我身上飛舞。
在那之中，那個男人衝進一間房子
又立刻跑了出來。
看見他，手持蓬草小弓，搭著蓬草小箭
從那邊，笑咪咪地，瞄準著我。
看到那樣，我覺得很好笑。
「那樣小小的蓬草箭，怎麼可能傷人。」
我一邊想著，一邊發出獠牙的怒吼
正要一口將他吞下
那時，那個男人狠狠地射中我的脖子。
從那之後，我就什麼都不知道了。
突然回過神來，發現
我身處於巨大的龍的兩耳之間。
村裡的人們聚集起來，那個我追趕的年輕人
大聲地指揮著，將我的屍體仔細地切成碎片
運到一處燒掉，然後將灰燼
丟棄在山岩的後面。
現在我才明白，我以為的只是一個人類
一個普通的年輕人
是 Okikirmui，神之勇者。
我是可怕的惡神，邪魔神，因為我
在人類村莊的附近，
Okikirmui 為了村莊的安危，故意激怒我
讓我追趕他，然後用蓬草箭殺了我。
還有，先前被我吞下的
青面男子，我以為是人類
那是 Okikirmui 用他的排泄物創造出來的人形，
帶來的。
我是魔神，現在已經被送往
地獄的可怕的邪惡國度
從今以後，人類的國度，將不會有任何危險
也不會有任何阻礙。
我是可怕的魔神，
卻敗在一個人類的計謀之下
現在只能以無聊的死法，悲慘地死去。
沼澤的魔神如此講述著。

The Song of Harits Kunna, sung by the Marsh Demon himself:

Harits Kunna,
One bright day,
From my swamp, with just eyes and mouth peeking,
I gazed out.
In the distance, from the shore, I heard voices.
I saw two young men approaching side by side.
The one in front seemed a hero, possessing a hero's aura,
Beautiful as a god.
But the one behind looked gaunt,
His complexion poor. They walked and talked,
Passing by my swamp.
Just as they reached me, the pale-faced man
Stopped, pinching his nose.
"Oh, how foul! This wretched swamp! Passing through this awful place
Is so filthy! What is that stench? It's disgusting!"
I listened, and rage swelled within me, almost forgetting myself.
I burst from the mire. I leaped up,
The earth cracked, the ground crumbled. I roared with fangs bared,
Ferociously chasing after them.
The one in front, sensing danger,
Turned with the agility of a fish, darting under the pale man's
Arm and fleeing swiftly.
I pursued the sickly man for a few steps,
Quickly catching up and swallowing him whole.
Then, with all my might, I chased after the one who had fled,
Reaching a human village, a large village.
I saw approaching from there
The old woman of fire, the divine crone, dressed in red, six layers of robes,
With a sash, draped in six layers,
Leaning on a red staff, rushing towards me.
"Hey, hey! What brings you to our Ainu village?
Go back! Go back!"
She cried, raising her red staff, her golden staff, striking
At me, the flames burning on the staff
Falling upon me like rain.
But I was unmoved,
Roaring with fangs bared, I continued to chase
The man, who ran through the village
Like a spinning wheel. I pursued relentlessly,
The earth cracked, the ground crumbled. The whole village was in chaos,
Some pulling their wives' hands, some pulling their children's hands, crying out
And fleeing, a scene of turmoil.
But I paid no heed, stirring up clouds of dust.
The fire goddess ran to my side,
Great flames dancing around me.
In the midst of it, the man darted into a house
And immediately ran out again.
I saw him, holding a small mugwort bow, nocking a mugwort arrow,
From there, smiling, aiming at me.
Seeing that, I found it amusing.
"Such a tiny mugwort arrow could never harm me!"
I thought, roaring with fangs bared,
Just as I was about to swallow him whole,
That man struck my neck hard.
From then on, I knew nothing more.
When I suddenly came to, I found
Myself between the huge ears of a dragon.
The villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased
Commanded loudly, carefully cutting my corpse into pieces,
Carrying them to a place to burn, then casting the ashes
Behind the mountain rocks.
Now I understand that the one I thought was merely a human,
A simple young man,
Was Okikirmui, the divine hero.
I am the terrible evil god, the demon god, and because I was
Near the human village,
Okikirmui deliberately provoked me for the village's safety,
Causing me to chase him, then killing me with a mugwort arrow.
And the pale-faced man I swallowed earlier,
Whom I thought was human,
Was a humanoid created by Okikirmui from his excrement,
Brought along.
I am the demon god, now sent to
The terrible, evil realm of hell.
From now on, the human realm will be free from danger
And without hindrance.
I am the terrible demon god,
Yet I was defeated by a human's scheme,
And now I can only die a boring death, a miserable death.
So spoke the Marsh Demon.
