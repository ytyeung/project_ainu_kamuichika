序

在很久以前,這片廣闊的北海道,是我們祖先自由的天地。他們像天真爛漫的孩童一般,被美麗的大自然擁抱,悠閒快樂地生活著,真是大自然的寵兒,多麼幸福的人們啊!

冬日裡,他們踢開覆蓋林野的厚厚積雪,不畏冰凍天地的寒氣,翻山越嶺地獵熊;夏日裡,他們在涼風吹拂、綠波蕩漾的海面上,與白鷗的歌聲為伴,漂浮在如樹葉般的小舟上,終日捕魚;在鮮花盛開的春天,他們沐浴在柔和的陽光下,與永遠歌唱的小鳥一同歡度時光,採摘蜂斗菜和艾蒿;在紅葉似火的秋天,他們撥開被狂風吹拂、穗頭整齊的芒草,直到深夜捕鮭魚的篝火熄滅,在山谷間鹿鳴聲聲的陪伴下,對著皎潔的明月編織夢想。啊,多麼快樂的生活啊!和平的境地,如今都已是往昔,夢想破滅數十年,這片土地發生了急劇的變化,山野變成村莊,村莊變成城鎮,逐漸地開墾發展。

太古時代的自然風貌不知何時已漸漸消失,曾經在田野山邊快樂生活著的許多人民,他們的去向又在何方?僅僅殘存的我們同族,對於不斷前進的世態,只能驚訝地睜大眼睛。而且從那雙眼睛裡,昔日人們被一舉一動宗教觀念所支配的美麗靈魂的光輝已經消失,充滿著不安和不滿,變得遲鈍黯淡,看不清前方的道路,不得不依靠別人的慈悲,多麼可悲的姿態,啊,即將滅亡的事物......那就是現在我們的名字,我們擁有著多麼悲傷的名字啊!

在很久以前,幸福的我們的祖先,一定連一點點都無法想像,自己的這片故鄉最終會變成如此淒慘的模樣吧。

時間不斷流逝,世界無限發展。在激烈的競爭場裡,即使是現在的我們,正暴露著敗北的醜態,但總有一天,如果能出現兩三位堅強的人,與不斷前進的時代並肩前行的日子,也終將到來吧。那真的是我們迫切的願望,是我們日夜祈禱的事情。

但是......我們敬愛的祖先,為了在日常生活中互相溝通而使用的眾多語言,那些被說舊了、被遺留下來的許多美麗的詞語,難道也要全部無情地,隨著即將滅亡的弱者一同消失嗎?啊,那是多麼令人悲痛和惋惜的事情啊!

身為阿伊努人,在阿伊努語中成長的我,在下雨的夜晚,下雪的夜晚,每當有空閒的時候,便聚集在一起,將我們的祖先所講述的各種故事中,極小的一部分,用拙劣的筆觸記錄下來。

如果能讓了解我們的許多人閱讀到這些文字,我將與我們的同族祖先一同,感到無比的喜悅,無上的幸福。

大正十一年三月一日

Prologue

Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. They were truly the darlings of nature, such fortunate people!

In winter, they kicked away the thick snow covering the forests, braving the freezing cold to hunt bears across mountains and fields. In summer, accompanied by the songs of white gulls on the breezy, green-waved sea, they floated on leaf-like canoes, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they basked in the gentle sunlight, celebrating with the ever-singing birds, picking Fuki (蜂斗菜) and mugwort. In the autumn of fiery red leaves, they parted the wind-blown, neatly aligned Susuki (芒草), and until the bonfires for salmon fishing died out late at night, they dreamed under the bright moon, accompanied by the deer's calls in the valleys. Ah, what a joyful life! That peaceful state is now a thing of the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone drastic changes, with mountains and fields becoming villages, and villages becoming towns, gradually being developed.

The natural scenery of ancient times has gradually disappeared, and where have the many people who once lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? We, the few remaining of our people, can only stare in astonishment at the ever-advancing world. Moreover, the light of the beautiful souls, once governed by religious beliefs in every action, has vanished from those eyes, filled with anxiety and dissatisfaction, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others. What a pitiful sight! Ah, things on the verge of extinction... that is our current name, what a sad name we bear!

Long ago, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would eventually become so miserable.

Time flows on, and the world develops infinitely. In the fierce arena of competition, even as we now expose the ugly sight of defeat, someday, if two or three strong individuals emerge to walk alongside the ever-advancing era, that day will surely come. That is truly our fervent wish, the thing we pray for day and night.

But... our beloved ancestors, the many languages they used to communicate with each other in daily life, will all those beautiful words, worn out and left behind, also disappear mercilessly along with the weak who are about to perish? Ah, what a painful and regrettable thing that would be!

As an Ainu, raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights and snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather together and record, with clumsy strokes, a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors.

If these words can be read by the many who understand us, I will, together with our Ainu ancestors, feel immense joy and supreme happiness.
