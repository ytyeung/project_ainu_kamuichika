狐狸親自吟唱的歌謠「トワトワト」

トワトワト

某日，我前往海邊尋找食物。

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

我一路前行，眺望著前方，

只見海邊擱淺了一條鯨魚。

人們盛裝打扮，

歡欣鼓舞地慶祝海的恩賜，喜悅地跳舞，

切割肉者、搬運肉者，穿梭往來，

德高望重之人，感謝並祭拜海的饋贈，

磨刀霍霍者，遍布海灘，黑壓壓一片。

我見此情景，心中甚是歡喜。

「啊，真想快點抵達那裡，

哪怕只分到一小塊也好，」

我如此想著，一邊高呼「萬歲！萬歲！」

一邊

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

走啊走，靠近一看，

卻是萬萬沒想到，

原以為是鯨魚擱淺，

實則是海灘上犬隻的便溺之處，

堆積如山的糞便。

我竟將其誤認為鯨魚。

我原以為人們歡欣鼓舞地慶祝海的恩賜，喜悅地跳舞，

切割搬運鯨魚肉，

實際上是烏鴉們

啄食糞便，四處散落，

忽而飛向這邊，忽而飛向那邊。

我怒火中燒。

「真是眼光昏花的蠢貨，

眼光昏花的惡徒，

尾巴底下散發臭氣的傢伙，

尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出松脂的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出髒水的傢伙，

究竟是怎樣看待事物的啊！」

隨後，我又

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

從海邊奔跑，

放眼望去，我的前方

有一艘船，船上有兩個人

正在互致哀悼之詞。

「哎呀，發生了什麼變故，

才會讓他們做出那樣的舉動呢？莫非

是有人連人帶船翻覆了嗎？

啊，真想快點靠近，

聽聽他們在說些什麼。」

我如此想著，便高聲呼喊「フオホホーイ！」

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

飛奔而去，結果發現

我以為的船，其實是海邊的

岩石，而我以為的人，

則是兩隻巨大的鵜鶘。

兩隻巨大的鵜鶘伸長或縮短脖子，

我卻將其看作是正在互致哀悼之詞。

「真是眼光昏花的蠢貨，

眼光昏花的惡徒，

尾巴底下散發臭氣的傢伙，

尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出松脂的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出髒水的傢伙，

究竟是怎樣看待事物的啊！」

之後，我又

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

飛也似地逆流而上，

只見遠遠的河的上游，有兩個女人

站在淺灘上，相對而泣。

我見此情景，大吃一驚。

「哎呀，發生了什麼不好的事情，

傳來了什麼凶訊，才會讓她們如此抱頭痛哭呢？

啊，真想快點趕到，

聽聽她們在說些什麼。」

我如此想著，

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

飛奔而去，結果發現

河流中央有兩個簗やな，

兩個簗やな的木樁受到水流衝擊，搖搖欲墜，

我卻以為是兩個女人或俯首或仰望，

相對而泣。

「真是眼光昏花的蠢貨，

眼光昏花的惡徒，

尾巴底下散發臭氣的傢伙，

尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出松脂的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出髒水的傢伙，

究竟是怎樣看待事物的啊！」

之後，我又逆流而上，

石礫之中，ちゃらちゃら作響，

木片之中，ちゃらちゃら低吟。

飛也似地趕回家。

放眼望去，

不知為何，

我的家燃起了熊熊大火，

升騰至天空的濃煙，

宛如堆積的雲朵。我見此情景，

大吃一驚，驚慌失措。

我發出女人的尖叫聲，

跳了起來，只見從對面

有人大聲呼喊著「ホーイ！」朝我

飛奔而來。定睛一看，原來是我的妻子，

她面色驚恐，氣喘吁吁地說道：

「您怎麼了，老爺？」

我再仔細一看，

看似火災的景象，

我的家卻完好無損地

佇立在那裡。沒有火，也沒有煙。

原來，是我的妻子正在舂米，

當時風很大，吹散了正在揚起的粟米的

糠秕，

我卻將其看作是煙霧。

我出門尋找食物，卻一無所獲，而且

又因為我大聲呼叫，我的妻子

受到驚嚇，連同簸箕一起

將正在揚的粟米都扔掉了，

今晚恐怕是無以為食了。

我怒不可遏，一頭栽倒在床底下，

睡著了。

「真是眼光昏花的蠢貨，

眼光昏花的惡徒，

尾巴底下散發臭氣的傢伙，

尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出松脂的傢伙，

屁股眼裡流出髒水的傢伙，

究竟是怎樣看待事物的啊！」

狐狸的頭目如此講述道。

The Fox's Own Ballad: "Towatowato"

Towatowato,

One day, I went to the shore in search of food.

Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

I walked on, gazing ahead,
And saw a whale, stranded on the beach.

People dressed in finery,
Celebrating the sea's bounty with joyful dance,
Cutters of meat, carriers of meat, bustling to and fro,
The esteemed ones, giving thanks and offering prayers,
Sharpeners of knives, a dark mass upon the sand.

Seeing this, my heart was filled with joy.

"Ah, how I long to reach that place,
Even a small piece would suffice,"
I thought, as I cried, "Banzai! Banzai!"

And so,
Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

I walked and walked, drawing closer, only to find,

It was not a whale stranded there,
But a mound of canine dung upon the shore,
A mountain of excrement.

I had mistaken it for a whale.

I thought people were celebrating the sea's bounty with joyful dance,
Cutting and carrying whale meat,
But it was crows,
Pecking at the dung, scattering it wide,
Flying here, flying there.

I was consumed by rage.

"Blind fool that I am,
Blind villain,
Stinking from the tail,
Rotting from the tail,
Resin flowing from the anus,
Filth flowing from the anus,
How could I have seen things so wrong!"

Then again,
Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

I ran from the shore,
And in the distance, I saw
A boat with two figures,
Exchanging words of sorrow.

"Alas, what misfortune has befallen them,
That they should act in such a way? Perhaps
A boat has capsized, taking souls with it?
Ah, how I long to draw near,
To hear what they lament."

So I thought, and cried, "Hohhohooi!"

Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

I rushed onward, only to find
The boat I saw was but
A rock upon the shore, and the figures,
Two great pelicans.

Two great pelicans, stretching and shrinking their necks,
I had mistaken them for mourners.

"Blind fool that I am,
Blind villain,
Stinking from the tail,
Rotting from the tail,
Resin flowing from the anus,
Filth flowing from the anus,
How could I have seen things so wrong!"

After that, I again,
Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

Ran swiftly upstream,
And far in the river's upper reaches, I saw two women
Standing in the shallows, weeping face to face.

Seeing this, I was greatly alarmed.

"Alas, what ill has befallen them,
What dire news has arrived, that they should weep so?
Ah, how I long to reach them,
To hear what they lament."

So I thought,
Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

I rushed onward, only to find
Two 'yana' weirs in the river's heart,
The stakes of the two 'yana' weirs, buffeted by the current, swayed,
I had mistaken them for two women, heads bowed or raised,
Weeping face to face.

"Blind fool that I am,
Blind villain,
Stinking from the tail,
Rotting from the tail,
Resin flowing from the anus,
Filth flowing from the anus,
How could I have seen things so wrong!"

After that, I went upstream again,
Among the pebbles, a 'charachara' sound,
Among the driftwood, a 'charachara' sigh.

I hurried home.

Looking ahead,
For some reason,
My house was ablaze,
The smoke rising to the sky,
Like piled-up clouds. Seeing this,
I was shocked and dismayed.

I let out a woman's scream,
And jumped up, only to see someone
Shouting "Hoi!" and running towards me.
Looking closely, it was my wife,
Her face filled with terror, gasping for breath, she said:

"What is wrong, my lord?"

Looking again,
The scene of the fire,
My house stood there,
Untouched. No fire, no smoke.

It turned out my wife was hulling millet,
The wind was strong, scattering the rising
Chaff of the millet,
I had mistaken it for smoke.

I went out in search of food, but found nothing, and
Because of my shouting, my wife
Was startled, and threw away the millet she was winnowing,
Together with the winnowing basket.
Tonight, we will likely have nothing to eat.

I was overcome with anger, and fell under the bed,
And slept.

"Blind fool that I am,
Blind villain,
Stinking from the tail,
Rotting from the tail,
Resin flowing from the anus,
Filth flowing from the anus,
How could I have seen things so wrong!"

So spoke the Fox's chieftain.
