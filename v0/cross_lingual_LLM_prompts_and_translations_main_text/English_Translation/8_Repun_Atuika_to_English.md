海神親自吟唱的歌謠「アトイカ
トマトマキ クントテアシ フム フム!」

アトイカ トマトマキ クントテアシ フムフム
長兄，六位兄長，長姊，六位姊姊。
短兄，六位兄長，短姊，六位姊姊。
他們養育著我，而我呢？
在堆滿寶物之處搭建高床，於那高床之上，
只是靜靜地雕刻刀鞘，
日復一日，以此為生。
每日清晨，兄長們便
背起箭筒，與姊姊們一同出門，
到了傍晚，總是面帶疲色地
空手而歸。姊姊們明明也很疲憊，卻仍要準備餐食，為我擺上飯菜，
自己也用過餐後，收拾完畢，
兄長們便又忙碌地製作弓箭。
待箭筒裝滿，大家因為疲憊不堪，
入睡後便發出震天鼾聲。
隔天，天色未亮，
眾人便起身，姊姊們準備餐食，為我擺上飯菜，
大家用過餐後，又背起箭筒，
出門而去。傍晚時分，又
面帶疲色地空手而歸，
姊姊們準備餐食，兄長們製作弓箭，
日復一日，年復一年，總是重複著相同的事情。
某日，兄長們和姊姊們又
背起箭筒，出門而去。
我本在雕刻寶物，不久便
起身站上高床，手持金弓
金箭，走出戶外。
放眼望去，大海遼闊平靜，
鯨魚們在海的東邊、海的西邊，
嬉戲玩耍。此時，
海的東邊，長姊和六位姊姊手牽著手，圍成一個圓圈，
短姊和六位姊姊，則將鯨魚趕入圈中，
長兄和六位兄長，短兄和六位兄長，
瞄準圈中的鯨魚射箭，箭矢
從鯨魚的下方穿過，從鯨魚的上方掠過。
他們每日每日，都在做著這樣的事情。
我看到大海中央，
巨大的鯨魚和牠的孩子，正在海面上上下下地
嬉戲玩耍，
便從遠處搭上金弓金箭，
瞄準射去，一箭
同時貫穿了鯨魚母子。
於是，我將其中一條鯨魚從中間斬斷，
將一半拋入姊姊們的圈中。
然後，將另一條半的鯨魚
放在尾巴下方，朝著人類的國度
前進，抵達オタシュツ村，
將那條半的鯨魚
推上了村莊的海灘。
之後，我悠然地在海面上
游動，返回，
卻聽到有人
氣喘吁吁地在身旁奔跑，
定睛一看，原來是海鷗。
牠上氣不接下氣地說道：
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
勇敢的神明啊，偉大的神明啊，
您為何要將如此豐厚的海產，賜予卑賤的人類，邪惡的人類呢？
卑賤的人類，邪惡的人類，正用斧頭
和鐮刀，將巨大的海產切割、戳刺、
削刮！勇敢的神明，
偉大的神明啊，快將大海產
收回去吧！您賜予他們如此多的海產，
卑賤的人類，邪惡的人類卻
不知感恩，竟做出這樣的事情！」
聽了牠的話，我笑著說道：
「我既然已經將海產賜予人類，
現在就是他們的東西了，人類
要用鐮刀戳刺，還是用斧頭
削刮，都隨他們的便，
他們想怎麼吃就怎麼吃，
那又如何呢？」
海鷗聽了，雖然有些不知所措，
我卻毫不在意，繼續在海面上
悠然地游動，
眼看太陽就要下山，我回到了自己的海域。
只見
十二位兄長，十二位
姊姊，正為了搬運那半條鯨魚而
精疲力竭，大家一起高聲呼喊，
卻還在海的東邊，慢吞吞地搬運著。
我實在是感到無語。
我沒有理會他們，直接回到
家中，在高床上坐下。
於是我回頭望向人類的世界，
只見我推上海灘的那條
半的鯨魚周圍，聚集著盛裝打扮的
體面的男人和
體面的女人，他們歡欣鼓舞地
慶祝海產，在後方的沙丘
上，鋪著華麗的地毯，
オタシュツ村的村長
身穿六件和服，束緊腰帶，
頭戴華麗的神之冠冕，祖先的冠冕，
腰佩神授之劍，
以神祇般莊嚴美麗的姿態，高舉雙手，
進行禮拜。人類們喜極而泣，
慶祝海產。
海鷗說人類
用斧頭和鐮刀戳刺我推上海灘的鯨魚，
但事實上，
村長和
村民們，正取出
自古以來被視為最珍貴寶物的神劍，
用它來切割鯨魚肉，並將其搬運。
而且，我的兄長們和姊姊們，似乎也沒有要回來的
跡象。
過了兩三天，我看到窗戶邊
好像有什麼東西，於是我
轉頭望去，只見窗戶上
放著一個裝滿
美酒的金杯，杯上
橫放著裝飾著御幣的酒箸，
使者來回走動，口中唸唸有詞地說道：
「我是オタシュツ村的人，
雖然冒昧，但還是要獻上美酒。」
オタシュツ村的村長代表
全體村民，詳細地向我表達謝意，
並說道：
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
如果不是偉大的神明，勇敢的神明，
又會有誰，在我們的村莊遭受饑荒，
已經到了走投無路的地步時，憐憫我們呢？
您賜予我們村莊生命，
實在是太感謝您了！我們歡慶海產，
製作了些許美酒，
並附上小小的幣束，
向大神您表達謝意。」
裝飾著御幣的酒箸來回走動，如此陳述。
於是我起身，拿起
金杯，高舉過頭，
打開上方座位的六個酒桶的蓋子，
將美酒一點一點地倒入
金杯中，再將金杯放到窗戶上。
做完這些，我便在高床上坐下，
只見那金杯和酒箸，已經
消失不見了。之後，我繼續雕刻刀鞘，
雕琢刀鞘，不知不覺地
抬起頭來，
只見屋內擺滿了美麗的幣束，
屋內白雲繚繞，白色的閃電
閃爍著光芒。我覺得真是太美了。
又過了兩三天，
這時，我終於聽到
家門外，兄長們和
姊姊們高聲呼喊著，拉著那條鯨魚回來了。我感到非常驚訝。
我望著他們進入屋內的樣子，
只見兄長們和姊姊們
非常疲憊，臉色也憔悴不堪。
大家進入屋內，看到這麼多的幣束，
驚訝地反覆膜拜。
不久，東邊座位的六個酒桶
都滿溢出來，神明喜愛的美
酒香氣在屋內瀰漫。
之後，我用美麗的幣束裝飾屋內，
邀請遠方的神明，近鄰的神明，
舉辦盛大的酒宴。姊姊們
烹煮鯨魚肉，獻給神明們，
神明們都讚不絕口，非常高興。
宴會正酣時，我起身，
詳細地講述了人間世界遭受饑荒，
我憐憫他們，將海產推上海灘的經過，
以及我善待人類，卻遭到邪惡神明的
嫉妒，海鷗中傷我的事情，
還有オタシュツ村的
村長以如此這般的言語向我表達謝意，
裝飾著幣束的酒箸前來擔任使者等等。
神明們聽了，
一致點頭稱是，
讚揚我。
之後，我又舉辦了盛大的宴會，
神明們的
舞蹈聲，歌唱聲，
交織成美妙的樂章，姊姊們
手持提壺，在席間斟酒，
有的則與女神們
一同高歌。
過了兩三天，宴會結束。
我將兩三個美麗的幣束
贈送給神明們，神明們彎下腰，
反覆行禮，
各自返回自己的家。
在那之後，總是和長兄，六位兄長，
長姊，六位姊姊，短姊，六位姊姊，
短兄，六位兄長在一起，
人類們每次釀酒，
都會送酒給我，並送來幣束。
現在，人類們已經沒有食物不足的
困擾，過著平穩的
生活，我也感到安心了。

The song of the Sea God himself, "Atoika Tomatoma ki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!"

Atoika Tomatoma ki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!
My eldest brother, six brothers, my eldest sister, six sisters.
My younger brother, six brothers, my younger sister, six sisters.
They raised me, and what did I do?
In a place overflowing with treasures, I built a high platform, and upon that platform,
I quietly carved scabbards,
Day after day, making my living thus.
Every morning, my brothers would
Carry their quivers, going out with my sisters,
And every evening, they would return weary,
Their hands empty. My sisters, though tired, would still prepare meals, setting the food before me,
And after eating themselves, they would clean up,
While my brothers busied themselves making bows and arrows.
Once the quivers were full, everyone, exhausted,
Would fall asleep, their snores shaking the heavens.
The next day, before dawn,
Everyone would rise, my sisters preparing meals, setting the food before me,
And after eating, they would carry their quivers,
And go out again. In the evening, they would
Return weary, their hands empty,
My sisters preparing meals, my brothers making bows and arrows,
Day after day, year after year, always repeating the same things.
One day, my brothers and sisters again
Carried their quivers and went out.
I, who had been carving treasures, soon
Rose and stood upon the high platform, holding a golden bow
And golden arrows, and went outside.
Looking out, the sea was vast and calm,
Whales frolicked in the east and west,
Playing and enjoying themselves. At that moment,
In the east, my eldest sister and six sisters held hands, forming a circle,
While my younger sister and six sisters drove the whales into the circle,
My eldest brother and six brothers, my younger brother and six brothers,
Aimed their arrows at the whales within the circle, the arrows
Passing beneath the whales, skimming above them.
Every day, they did this.
I saw in the center of the sea,
A giant whale and her child, rising and falling on the waves,
Playing and enjoying themselves,
So from afar, I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow,
Aimed, and shot, an arrow
Piercing both the mother and child at once.
Then, I cut one of the whales in half,
Throwing half into my sisters' circle.
And the other half of the whale,
I placed tail-down and pushed it towards the land of humans,
Reaching the village of Otasutsu,
And pushed that half-whale
Onto the village's beach.
After that, I leisurely
Swam in the sea, returning,
When I heard someone
Running breathlessly beside me,
Looking closely, I saw it was a seagull.
It said, gasping for air:
"Tomin karikuru Kamui karikuru Iso yangke kuru
Brave God, Great God,
Why would you bestow such abundant sea bounty upon lowly humans, wicked humans?
Lowly humans, wicked humans, are using axes
And sickles to cut, stab,
And scrape the great sea bounty! Brave God,
Great God, please take back
The sea bounty! You have given them so much,
But lowly humans, wicked humans,
Are ungrateful and do such things!"
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Now that I have given the sea bounty to humans,
It is theirs. Whether humans
Stab it with sickles or
Scrape it with axes, it is up to them,
They can eat it however they wish,
What does it matter?"
The seagull, hearing this, was somewhat bewildered,
But I paid it no mind, continuing to
Swim leisurely in the sea,
As the sun began to set, I returned to my sea.
There,
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, were struggling to carry
That half-whale, exhausted, shouting together,
Still slowly carrying it on the east side of the sea.
I was speechless.
I ignored them, returning directly
Home, and sat upon the high platform.
Then I looked back towards the human world,
And saw that around the half-whale
I had pushed onto the beach, were gathered
Well-dressed men and
Women, celebrating the sea bounty with joy,
On the dunes behind,
Were spread magnificent carpets,
The village chief of Otasutsu,
Wearing six kimonos, tightening his belt,
With a splendid crown of the gods, the crown of ancestors,
A divine sword at his waist,
In a godlike, solemn, and beautiful pose, raised both hands,
And offered prayers. The humans wept with joy,
Celebrating the sea bounty.
The seagull said that humans
Were stabbing the whale I pushed onto the beach with axes and sickles,
But in fact,
The village chief and
The villagers were taking out
The divine sword, considered the most precious treasure since ancient times,
Using it to cut the whale meat and carry it away.
Moreover, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of
Returning.
Two or three days passed, and I saw something
Near the window, so I
Turned to look, and saw on the window
Was placed a golden cup filled with
Fine sake, with
Decorated chopsticks laid across it,
A messenger pacing back and forth, chanting:
"I am from the village of Otasutsu,
Though it is presumptuous, I must offer this fine sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu, representing
All the villagers, expressed their gratitude in detail,
Saying:
"Tomin karikuru Kamui karikuru Iso yangke kuru
If not for the Great God, the Brave God,
Who would have had pity on our village, suffering from famine,
Having reached the end of our rope?
You have given our village life,
We are so grateful! We celebrate the sea bounty,
And have made a little sake,
And attached a small offering of inao,
To express our gratitude to the Great God."
The decorated chopsticks moved back and forth, stating this.
So I rose, took the
Golden cup, raised it above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels above my seat,
And poured the fine sake little by little into the
Golden cup, then placed the golden cup on the window.
Having done this, I sat on the high platform,
And the golden cup and chopsticks had
Disappeared. After that, I continued to carve scabbards,
Carving scabbards, and unconsciously
Looked up,
And saw the room filled with beautiful inao,
White clouds swirling within, white lightning
Flashing. I thought it was truly beautiful.
Two or three days passed again,
And then, I finally heard
Outside the door, my brothers and
Sisters shouting loudly, pulling that whale back. I was very surprised.
I watched them enter the house,
And saw that my brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces haggard.
Everyone entered the house, saw so many inao,
And repeatedly bowed in surprise.
Soon, the six sake barrels on the east side
Overflowed, and the fragrance of the gods' beloved
Sake filled the room.
After that, I decorated the room with beautiful inao,
Invited distant gods, neighboring gods,
And held a grand banquet. My sisters
Cooked whale meat, offering it to the gods,
Who praised it endlessly, very pleased.
As the banquet was in full swing, I rose,
And explained in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,
And how I had pity on them, pushing the sea bounty onto the beach,
And how I had treated humans kindly, but was envied by evil gods,
And how the seagull slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu
Expressed his gratitude in such and such words,
And how the chopsticks decorated with inao came as messengers, and so on.
The gods listened,
And unanimously nodded in agreement,
Praising me.
After that, I held another grand banquet,
The gods'
dancing, singing,
Intertwined into beautiful music, my sisters
Holding pitchers, pouring sake at the tables,
Some singing with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the banquet ended.
I gave two or three beautiful inao
To the gods, who bowed,
Repeatedly, and
Returned to their homes.
After that, I was always with my eldest brother, six brothers,
Eldest sister, six sisters, younger sister, six sisters,
Younger brother, six brothers,
And every time humans brewed sake,
They would send me sake and inao.
Now, humans no longer have to worry about a lack of food,
Living a peaceful
Life, and I am at ease.
