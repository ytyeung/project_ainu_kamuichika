The bog demon himself sang this song, "Harits Kunna":

Harits Kunna

One day, the weather was fine,
So I peeked out from my bog,
Just my eyes and mouth showing.
From the direction of the shore,
I heard the voices of men.
I saw two young men approaching together.

The first seemed a hero,
Possessing the qualities of a brave warrior,
Beautiful as a god.
But the one who followed behind,
He looked unwell,
Pale of face.
They came along discussing something,
And as they passed by my bog,
Right in front of me,
The pale-faced man stopped.
He covered his nose and said,
"Oh, how foul! This wretched bog!
Passing by this awful place,
It's so filthy! What is that stench?"

I only heard his words,
But I was enraged beyond measure,
Unsure if I even existed anymore.
I burst forth from the mud!
The earth split and cracked as I leaped.
Gnashing my teeth,
I fiercely pursued them.

The first man, seeing this,
Turned back like a fish darting around,
Slipped under the pale man's arm,
And fled far away.
I chased the blue-faced man for a few steps,
Quickly caught up,
And swallowed him whole, head first.

Then, with all my might, I chased after the other man,
Reaching a human village,
A large settlement.
I saw coming towards me,
The Fire Old Woman, the Divine Old Woman,
In red robes, six layers of them,
With a sash tied, wearing all six layers,
And leaning on a red staff, she flew to my side.

"Well, well," she said,
"Why have you come to this Ainu village?
Now, go back! Go back!"
As she spoke, she raised her red staff, her metal staff,
And struck me.
Flames rained down from the staff,
Like a downpour upon me.

But I paid no heed,
Gnashing my teeth,
I chased after the man.
He ran through the village,
Like a ring spinning around.
I flew after him,
And the earth split and cracked.
The village was in uproar,
Some pulling their wives by the hand,
Others dragging their children,
Crying and screaming,
Fleeing in a boiling frenzy.

But I cared not,
Raising a storm of dust.
The Fire Old Goddess ran beside me,
And tremendous flames flew over me.

In the midst of this,
The man darted into a house,
And immediately burst out again.
I saw him nocking a small arrow of artemisia to a small bow of artemisia,
Smiling at me from afar, aiming.
Seeing this, I found it amusing.
"How can such a tiny artemisia arrow cause harm?"
I thought, gnashing my teeth,
And tried to swallow him head first.

At that moment, the man shot me square in the neck.
After that, I knew no more.
When I came to my senses,
I was between the ears of a great dragon.

The villagers gathered,
And the young man I had chased,
Gave loud instructions.
They meticulously cut up my corpse,
Carried it to one place, burned it,
And scattered the ashes
Behind a rock on the mountain.

Only now do I realize,
That the one I thought was just a human,
Just a young man,
Was Okikirmui, a divine hero.
I was a terrible, evil god, a demon god,
And because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui, thinking of the village's safety,
Provoked me,
Made me chase him,
And killed me with an artemisia arrow.

And the blue-faced man I swallowed,
I thought he was human,
But it was Okikirmui who created a being from his own excrement,
And brought it along.

Because I was a demon,
I have now been cast into
The terrible, evil land of hell.
From now on, there will be no danger,
No disturbance,
In the land of humans.

I was a fearsome demon,
But I was defeated by the scheme of a single human,
And now I face a meaningless death, a wretched end."

So spoke the bog demon.

沼澤惡魔親自吟唱了這首歌，「Harits Kunna」：

Harits Kunna

一日，天氣晴朗，
我從沼澤中探出頭來，
僅露出眼睛和嘴巴。
從岸邊的方向，
我聽到了人們的聲音。
我看到兩個年輕人一同走來。

第一個看起來像個英雄，
具備勇敢戰士的品質，
如神般俊美。
但跟在後面的那個人，
他看起來不太好，
面色蒼白。
他們邊走邊討論著什麼，
當他們經過我的沼澤時，
就在我面前，
那個面色蒼白的人停下了腳步。
他捂住鼻子說，
「噢，多麼惡臭！這可惡的沼澤！
經過這個糟糕的地方，
太骯髒了！那是什麼臭味？」

我只聽到了他的話語，
但我卻怒不可遏，
不確定我是否還存在。
我從泥土中爆發而出！
大地裂開，在我跳躍時崩裂。
咬牙切齒，
我兇猛地追趕他們。

第一個人看到這一幕，
像魚兒般轉身，
從那個面色蒼白的人的胳膊下溜走，
逃之夭夭。
我追了那個臉色發青的人幾步，
迅速趕上，
將他整個吞下，頭朝下。

然後，我用盡全力追趕另一個人，
到達了一個人類的村莊，
一個大型聚落。
我看到朝我走來，
火焰老婦，神聖的老婦，
身穿紅色長袍，六層之多，
繫著腰帶，穿著所有六層，
拄著一根紅色手杖，她飛到我身邊。

「好吧，好吧，」她說，
「你為什麼來到這個Ainu村莊？
現在，回去！回去！」
她說著，舉起她的紅色手杖，她的金屬手杖，
擊打我。
火焰從手杖上傾瀉而下，
像暴雨般落在我身上。

但我毫不在意，
咬牙切齒，
我追趕著那個人。
他穿過村莊，
像個陀螺般旋轉。
我追著他飛去，
大地裂開崩裂。
村莊一片譁然，
有些人拉著妻子的手，
有些人拖著孩子，
哭喊尖叫，
在沸騰的狂潮中逃離。

但我毫不在意，
揚起一陣塵土。
火焰老女神在我身邊奔跑，
巨大的火焰從我身上飛過。

在這之中，
那個人衝進一間房子，
然後立刻又衝了出來。
我看到他將一根小小的艾蒿箭搭在一張小小的艾蒿弓上，
從遠處對著我微笑，瞄準。
看到這一幕，我覺得很有趣。
「這樣一支小小的艾蒿箭怎麼可能造成傷害？」
我想，咬牙切齒，
並試圖將他頭朝下吞下。

就在那時，那個人射中我的脖子。
在那之後，我就什麼都不知道了。
當我恢復意識時，
我正處於一條巨龍的雙耳之間。

村民們聚集在一起，
而我追趕的那個年輕人，
發出響亮的指示。
他們仔細地切碎我的屍體，
將它運到一個地方，焚燒，
並將灰燼撒在
山上的岩石後面。

直到現在我才意識到，
我以為只是一個人類，
只是一個年輕人，
是Okikirmui，一位神聖的英雄。
我是一個可怕的、邪惡的神，一個惡魔神，
因為我靠近人類村莊，
Okikirmui，考慮到村莊的安全，
挑釁我，
讓我追趕他，
並用艾蒿箭殺死了我。

而我吞下的那個臉色發青的人，
我以為他是人類，
但那是Okikirmui用自己的排泄物創造的一個生物，
並把它帶了過來。

因為我是一個惡魔，
我現在被拋入
可怕的、邪惡的地獄。
從今以後，將不會有危險，
沒有騷擾，
在人類的土地上。

我是一個可怕的惡魔，
但我被一個人類的計謀打敗了，
現在我面臨著毫無意義的死亡，一個悲慘的結局。」

沼澤惡魔如是說。
