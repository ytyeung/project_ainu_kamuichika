The Fox's Own Song:
"Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat in my place.
One day, I ventured out and saw,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur
Set out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this,
The wicked thoughts within me stirred.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with light steps,
I ran, my waist swaying gently.
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood,
I cried, "Pau, pau!" and glared at the source of the river,
Summoning the demon of the storm. Then, from the river's
source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Erupted and entered the sea, and at once,
The upper sea became the lower, and
The lower sea became the upper. Okikirmui and the others'
fishing boat, at the meeting place of the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land,
Met with a sudden change and spun amidst the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed over the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown like a falling leaf,
On the verge of capsizing, but
Admirable were the humans, strong and resilient,
And the small boat glided through the wind,
Over the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
Devoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, at last, Samayunkur's
hands bled from above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I devoted myself,
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,
Cheering on the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka, the two of them,
Encouraged each other and bravely rowed the boat,
But then, at one moment, Shupunramka's
hands bled from above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps, I leaped, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, devoting myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a single thin garment wrapped around his body,
He rowed the boat, until
The oar he held broke in his hands.
Then, he leaped upon the exhausted Samayunkur,
Snatched the oar he held, and rowed the boat alone.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
Devoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, Samayunkur's rudder also
broke. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramka,
Took his oar, and
Bravely rowed the boat.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the fierce wind,
Never imagining that a human like him could find me,
He gazed at the center of my eyes,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His gentle face now filled with anger,
He fiddled with his bag,
And from within, he took out a small mugwort bow and
A small mugwort arrow.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
"What can a human do to frighten me?
What use is such a mugwort arrow?"
Thinking this, upon this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with light steps,
I ran, my waist swaying gently, with a heavy tone,
Like snapping wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
Praising the demon of the storm.
In the midst of this, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew and
Pierced me right at the collar of my neck.
After that, I lost all sense of what happened.
When I came to, I found
The weather was wonderfully fine, and the sea was
Vast, with no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it ached as if the bark of a tree was burning and shrinking.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so,
Then, writhing in agony, I struggled,
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, crying and screaming,
Writhing in agony, living and
Dying, day and night, until I lost
All sense of what had happened.
When I came to, I found myself
Between the ears of a great black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui arrived, looking like a god,
Smiling and saying,
"How beautiful! The black fox god who watches over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Had a good heart, a godly heart,
And so died a beautiful death."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the foundation of his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
Then, day and night,
Suffering from the foul stench, I died a meaningless, bad
death.
Though I was not merely a god of low rank,
Because I possessed a terribly wicked heart, I died a useless,
bad death. Therefore,
Foxes of the future, never
Hold wicked thoughts."

So the fox god told his story.

狐之歌：
「Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori」

Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori，
於陸岬之上，神之岬角，
我安坐於此。
一日，我冒險外出，見到，
海面平靜而遼闊，其上，
Okikirmui、Shupunramka和Samayunkur
揚帆出海狩獵，三人同舟。 見此情景，
我心中邪念頓生。
此岬角，陸之岬，神之岬，
輕盈地，上下往復，
我奔跑著，腰肢輕擺。
以沉重的聲調，如木頭斷裂，
我呼喊：「Pau, pau！」怒視河流源頭，
召喚風暴的惡魔。 隨後，從河流的
源頭，狂風驟起，化作旋風，
爆發並衝入大海，頃刻間，
上方的海水變為下方，
下方的海水變為上方。 Okikirmui他們一行人的
漁船，在近海的人之海與陸地之人海的交匯處，
遭遇突變，在波濤中旋轉。
巨浪如山，
傾覆船隻。 隨後，
Okikirmui、Samayunkur和Shupunramka
齊聲呼喊，奮力划槳。
小船如落葉般飄搖，
瀕臨傾覆，但
人類可敬，堅韌而頑強，
小船乘風破浪，
越過波濤。
見此情景，我心中邪念再起。
輕盈地，我奔跑著，腰肢輕擺，
以沉重的聲調，如木頭斷裂，我呼喊：「Pau, pau！」
全心投入，為風暴的惡魔助威。
正當我如此做時，最終，Samayunkur的
雙手上下皆血流如注，
力竭倒下。 見此情景，
我暗自竊笑。
隨後再次，我全心投入，
輕盈地，我奔跑著，腰肢輕擺，
以沉重的聲調，如木頭斷裂，
為風暴的惡魔助威。
Okikirmui和Shupunramka，他們兩人，
互相鼓勵，勇敢地划槳，
但隨後，在某一刻，Shupunramka的
雙手上下皆血流如注，
力竭倒下。 見此情景，
我暗自竊笑。
隨後再次，輕盈地，我跳躍著，腰肢輕擺，
以沉重的聲調，如木頭斷裂，我呼喊著，全心投入。
但Okikirmui卻毫無疲態。
僅以單薄的衣衫裹身，
他划動船槳，直到
手中的船槳斷裂。
隨後，他躍向精疲力竭的Samayunkur，
奪過他手中的船槳，獨自划船。
見此情景，我心中邪念頓生。
以沉重的聲調，如木頭斷裂，我呼喊，
輕盈地，我奔跑著，腰肢輕擺，
全心投入，為風暴的惡魔助威。
正當我如此做時，Samayunkur的船舵也
斷裂了。 Okikirmui躍向Shupunramka，
奪過他的船槳，
勇敢地划船。
但他的船槳也被海浪折斷。
於是，Okikirmui站立於
船中，於狂風之中，
從未想過像他這樣的人類能夠找到我，
他凝視著我雙眼的中心，
於陸岬之上，神之岬角。
他溫和的面容此刻充滿怒火，
他擺弄著他的袋子，
從中，他取出一個小小的艾蒿弓和
一支小小的艾蒿箭。
見此情景，我暗自竊笑。
「人類能做什麼來嚇唬我？
這艾蒿箭又有何用？」
如此想著，於此岬角之上，
陸之岬，神之岬，
輕盈地，上下往復，
我奔跑著，腰肢輕擺，以沉重的聲調，
如木頭斷裂，我呼喊：「Pau, pau！」
讚美風暴的惡魔。
在此之中，Okikirmui射出的箭矢飛來，
正中我頸部的衣領。
在那之後，我失去了所有的知覺。
當我醒來時，我發現
天氣晴朗，大海
遼闊，沒有Okikirmui漁船的蹤影。
發生了什麼？ 從我的頭頂
到我的腳趾，都疼痛得像是樹皮在燃燒和收縮。
從未想過人類射出的小小箭矢竟能如此折磨我，
隨後，在痛苦中掙扎，
於此岬角之上，陸之岬，神之岬，
上下往復，哭喊尖叫，
在痛苦中掙扎，苟延殘喘，
日復一日，直到我失去
所有知覺。
當我醒來時，我發現自己
身處一隻巨大的黑狐的雙耳之間。
兩天後，Okikirmui到來，宛如神祇，
微笑著說，
「多麼美麗！ 守護著
陸之岬，神之岬的黑狐神，
擁有一顆善良的心，一顆神聖的心，
因此死得如此美麗。」
說著，他取下我的頭顱，
帶回他的家，用我的上顎骨
作為他廁所的基石，用我的下顎
作為他妻子廁所的基石，
而我的身體則與大地一同腐爛。
隨後，日日夜夜，
忍受著惡臭，我毫無意義地，悲慘地
死去。
儘管我並非僅僅是低階的神祇，
因為我擁有一顆極其邪惡的心，我徒勞地，
悲慘地死去。 因此，
未來的狐狸們，永遠不要
懷有邪惡的想法。」

狐神如此講述了他的故事。
