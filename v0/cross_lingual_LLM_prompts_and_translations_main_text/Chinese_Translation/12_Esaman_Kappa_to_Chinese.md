The Otter's Own Song:
"Kappa Reureu Kappa"

Kappa Reureu Kappa,
One day, as I played along the stream,
Swimming down, I came to Samayunkuru's
Water-drawing path.
Samayunkuru's sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Carried a bucket in one hand and
A bundle of reeds in the other.
I poked my head out of the river's edge and asked,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden, startled, looked around,
And finding me, her face filled with anger,
"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!"
At her call, large dogs came rushing,
Baring their fangs at me. Startled, I dove
To the river bottom and fled downstream.

Then, at the mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing path,
I peeked out again. Okikirmui's sister,
Beautiful as a goddess, carried a bucket
In one hand and a bundle of reeds in the other.
I said to her,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden, startled, looked around,
And finding me, her face filled with anger,
"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!"
Large dogs came rushing at her call.
Remembering what happened before, I found it funny,
And as I dove to the river bottom to escape,
Though I never imagined the dogs would do such a thing,
They leaped into the river, fangs bared,
Dragging me ashore, biting and tearing
At my head and body, until I lost consciousness.

When I awoke, I found myself
Sitting between the ears of a great otter.
I knew that neither Samayunkuru nor Okikirmui
Had father or mother, and I played that prank,
So I was punished, killed by Okikirmui's dogs,
A meaningless, wretched death.

Future otters, never play such pranks.
So, the otter told his tale.

水獺之歌：
「Kappa Reureu Kappa」

Kappa Reureu Kappa,
某日，嬉戲於溪流之間，
順流而下，我來到了Samayunkuru的
汲水之路。
Samayunkuru的妹妹，美若天仙，
一手提著水桶，
一手抱著一捆蘆葦。
我從河岸邊探出頭，問道：
「妳有父親嗎？
妳有母親嗎？」
少女嚇了一跳，四處張望，
發現了我，頓時怒容滿面，
「喔，你這可恨的扁頭，你這邪惡的扁頭，
竟敢取笑人！狗兒們，上！」
隨著她的呼喚，大狗們蜂擁而至，
對我齜牙咧嘴。我嚇了一跳，潛入
河底，向下游逃去。

之後，在Okikirmui的汲水之路的入口，
我又探出頭來。Okikirmui的妹妹，
美若天仙，一手提著水桶，
一手抱著一捆蘆葦。
我對她說：
「妳有父親嗎？
妳有母親嗎？」
少女嚇了一跳，四處張望，
發現了我，頓時怒容滿面，
「喔，你這可恨的扁頭，你這邪惡的扁頭，
竟敢取笑人！狗兒們，上！」
隨著她的呼喚，大狗們蜂擁而至。
記起之前發生的事，我感到好笑，
正當我潛入河底逃脫時，
雖然我從未想過狗兒們會做出這樣的事，
牠們竟躍入河中，露出獠牙，
將我拖上岸，撕咬著
我的頭和身體，直到我失去意識。

當我醒來時，我發現自己
坐在巨型水獺的雙耳之間。
我知道Samayunkuru和Okikirmui
都沒有父母，而我開了這個玩笑，
所以我受到了懲罰，被Okikirmui的狗殺死，
毫無意義，可悲的死亡。

未來的水獺們，永遠不要開這樣的玩笑。
水獺如此講述了他的故事。
