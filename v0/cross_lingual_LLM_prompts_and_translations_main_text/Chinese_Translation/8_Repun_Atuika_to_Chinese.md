The Song of the Sea God: An Atoika
Tomato Maki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!

Atoika Tomato Maki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!
My elder brothers, six in number, my elder sisters, six in number,
My younger brothers, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
They raised me, but I,
I had a raised platform built beside the treasures, and upon that platform,
I sat, carving and engraving scabbards,
That alone was my life's work.
Every morning, my brothers would
shoulder their quivers and go out with my sisters,
returning at dusk with weary faces,
empty-handed. My sisters,
despited their weariness, would prepare the meal, setting a tray before me,
then eating themselves. When the meal was done,
my brothers would busily make arrows.
When the quivers were full, they would all be so tired
they would fall asleep, snoring loudly.
The next day, while it was still dark,
they would all rise, my sisters preparing the meal and setting a tray for me.
When everyone had eaten, they would again shoulder their quivers
and depart. Again, in the evening,
they would return with weary faces, empty-handed,
my sisters preparing the meal, my brothers making arrows,
always doing the same things.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters
shouldered their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but soon
I rose from the platform, took a golden bow
and golden arrows, and went outside.
The sea was vast and calm,
whales playing to the east and west,
splashing and frolicking. Then,
to the east, my elder sisters, six in number, joined hands to form a ring,
my younger sisters, six in number, driving the whales into the ring.
My elder brothers, six in number, my younger brothers, six in number,
aimed and shot at the whales within the ring, their arrows
passing beneath and above the whales.
Every day, they did this.
I saw in the center of the sea
a large whale and its calf playing,
leaping up and down. From afar,
I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow
and aimed, piercing both the whale and its calf with a single shot.
Then, I cut the whale in half
and threw half into my sisters' ring.
Then, with the remaining whale and a half,
I placed it beneath its tail and headed towards the land of humans,
arriving at Otasutsu village.
I pushed the whale and a half
onto the village beach.
Then, I slowly
swam back across the sea,
when someone came running beside me,
out of breath. It was the sea grebe.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
Brave God, Great God,
why have you given such a great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes
and sickles to cut, poke, and scrape away at the great sea bounty.
Brave God,
Great God, please quickly
take back the great sea bounty. Even though you have given them so much,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
do not appreciate it and do such things!"
So I laughed and said,
"I have given it to the humans,
so now it is theirs. Let the humans
cut it with sickles or
scrape it with axes, let them eat it as they please.
What does it matter?" The sea grebe seemed discomfited,
but I paid it no mind and slowly swam across the sea,
arriving at my sea as the day was ending.
I saw
twelve brothers, twelve
sisters, unable to carry the half whale,
struggling together, shouting loudly,
grumbling to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.
I ignored them and went home,
sitting on the platform.
Then, looking back towards the human world,
I saw fine men and
fine women surrounding the whale and a half I had beached,
dressed in finery, rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty,
and on the dunes behind,
a fine mat was spread,
and upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,
bound in six layers of kimono and sash, wearing six layers of kimono,
crowned with a magnificent god's crown, an ancestral crown,
a divine sword at his waist,
looking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high
in prayer. The humans were crying
and rejoicing over the sea bounty.
What the grebe said about the humans
poking at the whale I had beached with axes and sickles was wrong.
The village chief and
the villagers were taking out the divine sword,
which they had always considered the most precious of treasures,
and using it to cut the meat and carry it away.
Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something seemed to appear in the window.
Looking back, I saw in the window
a golden cup overflowing
with sake, and upon it
were ceremonial chopsticks adorned with Nusa,
coming and going, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am from Otasutsu village,
and with great reverence, I offer you this sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu village,
representing all the villagers,
explained in detail how he was expressing his gratitude to me,
saying,
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
Great God, Brave God, who else
would have pity on our village, which was suffering from famine
and was in such dire straits
that we had no food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing in the sea bounty,
we have made a little sake,
added a small Nusa,
and are offering our thanks to the Great God."
This was what
the Nusa-adorned chopsticks conveyed, coming and going.
So I rose, took the golden cup,
held it high,
opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
poured a little of the fine sake into each,
and placed the golden cup in the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the platform
and saw that the cup and chopsticks
were gone. Then, carving
and engraving scabbards, I
suddenly looked up,
and the house was filled with beautiful Nusa,
white clouds drifting through the house, white lightning
flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then, again, two or three days passed,
and at last, I heard my brothers and
sisters outside the house, shouting loudly as they
pulled the whale.
I was amazed.
Watching them enter the house,
my brothers and sisters were
very tired, their faces pale.
Everyone came in, and when they saw the many Nusa,
they were surprised and bowed many times.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
were overflowing, and the scent of the god's favorite
sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful Nusa,
invited the gods of far and near,
and held a grand banquet. My sisters
boiled the whale and offered it to the gods,
who smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I rose
and told in detail how there was a famine in the human world
and how I had taken pity on them and beached the sea bounty,
how the wicked gods were jealous of this
and how the sea grebe had slandered me,
and how the village chief of Otasutsu village
had expressed his gratitude to me in such words
and how the Nusa-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy.
The gods
nodded in unison,
praising me.
Then, again, we held a grand banquet,
and the sounds of the gods
dancing and leaping here and there
made a beautiful harmony, and my sisters
carried pitchers, serving sake between the seats,
and sang with beautiful voices along with the goddesses.
The banquet ended after two or three days.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful Nusa each,
and the gods bent low at the waist,
bowing many times, and
each returned to their own home.
After that, as always, my elder brothers, six in number,
my elder sisters, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
my younger brothers, six in number, were with me,
and whenever the humans made sake,
they would send sake and Nusa to me.
Now, the humans have no lack of food
and live in peace without any trouble,
so I am at ease.

海神之歌：一個 Atoika
Tomato Maki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!

Atoika Tomato Maki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!
我的哥哥們，六位，我的姊姊們，六位，
我的弟弟們，六位，我的妹妹們，六位，
他們養育了我，但我，
我在寶藏旁建起高台，在那高台上，
我坐著，雕刻著刀鞘，
這就是我一生的工作。
每天早晨，我的哥哥們會
扛起箭筒，和我的姊姊們一同出門，
黃昏時帶著疲憊的面容歸來，
空手而回。我的姊姊們，
儘管疲憊，仍會準備餐點，在我面前擺上托盤，
然後自己才吃。用餐完畢後，
我的哥哥們會忙著製作箭矢。
當箭筒裝滿時，他們都已疲憊不堪，
沉沉睡去，鼾聲如雷。
隔天，天還未亮，
他們便起身，我的姊姊們準備餐點，為我擺上托盤。
當大家都吃飽後，他們再次扛起箭筒，
出發。同樣地，在傍晚，
他們帶著疲憊的面容歸來，空手而回，
我的姊姊們準備餐點，我的哥哥們製作箭矢，
日復一日，做著相同的事情。
有一天，我的哥哥和姊姊們
再次扛起箭筒，出門。
我正在雕刻寶藏，但很快地
我從高台上起身，拿起金弓
和金箭，走到外面。
大海遼闊而平靜，
鯨魚在東西兩側嬉戲，
濺起浪花，歡快地玩耍。然後，
在東邊，我的六位姊姊們手牽著手，圍成一個圈，
我的六位妹妹們則將鯨魚趕入圈中。
我的六位哥哥們，我的六位弟弟們，
瞄準圈中的鯨魚射擊，他們的箭矢
從鯨魚的下方和上方穿過。
每天，他們都這樣做。
我看見在海的中央，
一隻巨大的鯨魚和牠的小鯨魚正在玩耍，
上下跳躍。從遠處，
我將一支金箭搭在金弓上，
瞄準，一箭同時射穿了鯨魚和牠的小鯨魚。
然後，我將鯨魚切成兩半，
將一半扔進我姊妹們的圈子裡。
然後，用剩下的鯨魚一半，
我將其放在尾巴下方，朝著人類的土地前進，
抵達 Otasutsu 村。
我將鯨魚的一半
推到村莊的海灘上。
然後，我慢慢地
游回大海，
這時，有人氣喘吁吁地跑來我身邊，
是海鸊鷉。
牠氣喘吁吁地說，
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
勇敢的神，偉大的神，
您為何要將如此豐厚的海上恩賜給卑微的人類，邪惡的人類？
卑微的人類，邪惡的人類，正在使用斧頭
和鐮刀來切割、戳刺和刮取這巨大的海上恩賜。
勇敢的神，
偉大的神，請趕快
收回這巨大的海上恩賜。即使您給了他們這麼多，
卑微的人類，邪惡的人類，
也不懂得珍惜，還做出這樣的事情！"
於是我笑了，說，
"我已經把它給了人類，
所以現在它是他們的了。讓人類
用鐮刀切割它，或
用斧頭刮取它，讓他們隨意食用。
這有什麼關係呢？" 海鸊鷉似乎感到不安，
但我沒有理會牠，慢慢地游過大海，
在一天結束時抵達我的海域。
我看見
十二位哥哥，十二位
姊姊，無法搬運那半隻鯨魚，
一起掙扎，大聲呼喊，
在海的東邊抱怨。
我感到非常驚訝。
我沒有理會他們，直接回家，
坐在高台上。
然後，回頭看向人類世界，
我看見優秀的男人和
美麗的女人圍繞著我擱淺的那半隻鯨魚，
穿著華麗的服飾，為這海上恩賜歡欣鼓舞，
在後面的沙丘上，
鋪著一張精美的墊子，
在墊子上，是 Otasutsu 村的村長，
身穿六層和服和腰帶，
頭戴華麗的神之冠冕，祖傳的冠冕，
腰間佩戴著神聖的劍，
看起來像神一樣美麗，高舉雙手
祈禱。人類為這海上恩賜
哭泣和歡欣。
海鸊鷉所說的關於人類
用斧頭和鐮刀戳刺我擱淺的鯨魚是錯誤的。
村長和
村民們正在拿出神聖的劍，
他們一直認為這是最珍貴的寶藏，
並用它來切割肉並將其運走。
然後，我的哥哥和姊姊們沒有回來的跡象。
過了兩三天，似乎有東西出現在窗戶裡。
回頭一看，我看到在窗戶裡
一個金色的杯子滿溢著
清酒，上面
是裝飾著 Nusa 的祭祀筷子，
來來回回，作為使者傳達訊息，說，
"我來自 Otasutsu 村，
帶著極大的敬意，我向您獻上這杯清酒。"
Otasutsu 村的村長，
代表所有村民，
詳細地解釋了他如何向我表達他的感激之情，
說，
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
偉大的神，勇敢的神，還有誰
會憐憫我們這個遭受飢荒的村莊，
處於如此困境，
沒有食物？
非常感謝您為我們的村莊帶來生命。
為這海上恩賜感到高興，
我們釀造了一點清酒，
添加了一小塊 Nusa，
並向偉大的神表達我們的感謝。"
這就是
裝飾著 Nusa 的筷子所傳達的訊息，來來回回。
於是我起身，拿起金色的杯子，
高舉，
打開上座的六個清酒桶的蓋子，
在每個桶裡倒入一點精美的清酒，
然後將金色的杯子放在窗戶裡。
完成後，我坐在高台上，
看到杯子和筷子
消失了。然後，雕刻
刀鞘，我
突然抬頭，
房子裡充滿了美麗的 Nusa，
白色的雲朵在房子裡飄蕩，白色的閃電
明亮地閃爍。我想，「啊，多麼美麗。」
然後，又過了兩三天，
最後，我聽到我的哥哥和
姊姊們在房子外面大聲呼喊，他們
拉著鯨魚。
我感到很驚訝。
看著他們走進房子，
我的哥哥和姊姊們
非常疲憊，臉色蒼白。
大家都進來了，當他們看到許多 Nusa 時，
他們感到驚訝，並多次鞠躬。
同時，東座的六個清酒桶
溢了出來，神最喜歡的
清酒的香味充滿了房子。
然後我用美麗的 Nusa 裝飾房子，
邀請了遠近的神靈，
並舉行了盛大的宴會。我的姊姊們
煮了鯨魚，並將其獻給神靈，
神靈們咂著嘴，感到高興。
當宴會達到高潮時，我起身，
詳細地講述了人類世界如何遭受飢荒，
以及我如何憐憫他們，並將海上恩賜擱淺，
邪惡的神靈如何嫉妒這件事，
以及海鸊鷉如何誹謗我，
以及 Otasutsu 村的村長
如何用這樣的話語向我表達他的感激之情，
以及裝飾著 Nusa 的筷子如何作為使者前來。
神靈們
一致點頭，
稱讚我。
然後，我們再次舉行了盛大的宴會，
神靈們
跳舞和跳躍的聲音
奏出了美妙的和諧，我的姊姊們
提著水壺，在座位之間倒酒，
並與女神們一起用美妙的聲音歌唱。
宴會在兩三天後結束。
我給了神靈們兩三個美麗的 Nusa，
神靈們彎下腰，
多次鞠躬，
各自返回自己的家。
在那之後，一如既往，我的六位哥哥，
我的六位姊姊，我的六位妹妹，
我的六位弟弟，都和我在一起，
每當人類釀造清酒時，
他們都會送清酒和 Nusa 給我。
現在，人類不缺乏食物，
過著和平的生活，沒有任何麻煩，
所以我很安心。
