Translate the following text from Japanese to English. The original text is footnote. Keep the original meanings. For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form.

(1) アマツポ(弩いしゆみ)すなわち「仕掛け弓」を仕掛ける事.
(2) 刀剣.これは戦争の時に使う刀剣とは違うので,ふだん家の右座の宝物の積んである上に吊してあるのがそれです.戦争の時には使いませんが,uniwente などのときには使います.
```

### Output
```
Here's the translation of the footnotes from Japanese to English, preserving the original meaning and keeping non-Japanese terms as they are:

(1) Amatsupo (弩いしゆみ): That is, setting up a "trick bow."
(2) Swords. These are different from the swords used in war. They are usually hung above the pile of treasures on the right side of the house. They are not used in war, but are used during *uniwente*, etc.
