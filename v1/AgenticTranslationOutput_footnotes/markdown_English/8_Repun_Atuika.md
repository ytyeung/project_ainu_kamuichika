(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) It is a decoration with gohei, and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as a proxy for humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei are called iku pashui (chopsticks for feasts).

This is the English Translation 2.
(1) The items decorated with gohei are used when offering sacred sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as an agent of humans, conveying what humans want to say to the gods. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei decorations are called iku pashui (chopsticks for feasts).
