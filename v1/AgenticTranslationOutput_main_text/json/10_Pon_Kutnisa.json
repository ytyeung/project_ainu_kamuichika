        "input_prompt": "You are translating the following text from source language Japanese into target language English. The original text is a Japanese translation of a Ainu chant, sung by Ainu god telling his story. \nYou have 2 versions of English translations at hand.\n\nHere are your tasks:\n\n1. Compare the two English translations with the source Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the Translations.\n2. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the accuracy of original meaning with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].\nWhere one star means \"Nonsense/No meaning preserved\",\ntwo stars mean \"Some meaning preserved, but not understandable\",\nthree stars mean \"Some meaning preserved and understandable\",\nfour stars mean \"Most meaning preserved with possibly few grammar mistakes\",\nand five stars mean \"Perfect meaning and grammar\".\n\n3. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the easiness to understanding with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].\nWhere one star means \"The text is completely not understandable.\",\ntwo stars mean \"Most part of text is not understandable.\",\nthree stars mean \"While the text is understandable, the word usage and grammar are difficult.\",\nfour stars mean \"Most part of text can be understood easily.\",\nand five stars mean \"All part of text can be understood easily.\".\n\n4. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the poetic flow with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].\nWhere one star means \"All the text is literal and plain.\",\ntwo stars mean \"Most part of text is literal.\",\nthree stars mean \"While the text flow is smooth, some part of the text is still literal and does not sound poetic.\",\nfour stars mean \"Most part of text is poetic.\",\nand five stars mean \"All part of the text is a poet and rhythmic. It is a chant.\".\n\n5. Choose a better translation according to the weighted score. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion (50%). Easiness to understanding is the second (30%). Poetic flow is the third (20%).\n6. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.\n\nKeep the original meaning accurately. \nIf a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.\n\nThis is the Japanese text.\n小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡\n「クツニサ クトンクトン」\n\nクツニサ クトンクトン\nある日に水源の方へ遊びに\n出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が\n胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに\n腰を曲げ曲げしている.\n私を見ると,いう事には,\n「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」\nという.見ると,胡桃の簗\nなものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水\nが流れて来て鮭どもが\n上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので\n泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので\n小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を\n引ったくり小男の腰の央を\n私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の\n腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい\n地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を\n揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の\n彼方まで届いている様だ.\nそれから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を\n出して,その杭を根本から\n折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.\n水源から清い風,清い水が\n流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.\n鮭どもは清い風,清い水に\n気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び\nながら,パチャパチャと\n上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし\n流れに沿うて帰って来た.と\n小さいオキキリムイが物語った.\n\nThis is the English Translation 1.\nKutunisa Kutonkuton,\nOne day, I went to play near the source of the river.\nThere, I saw a little man building a weir of walnut wood.\nHe was bent over, hammering stakes.\nWhen he saw me, he said,\n\"Who are you? Nephew, please help me!\"\nI looked, and it was a walnut weir.\nWalnut water, muddy water, flowed.\nThe salmon tried to swim upstream,\nbut they hated the walnut water\nand cried as they turned back.\nI was furious.\nI snatched the mallet from the little man\nand struck him in the small of his back.\nI struck so hard it echoed, \"Pon!\"\nI broke his back, killed him,\nand kicked him down to hell.\nI shook his walnut stakes,\nand they seemed to reach beyond six hells.\nThen, with all the strength in my back and body,\nI broke the stakes from their roots\nand kicked them down to hell.\nClear wind and clear water flowed from the source,\nand the salmon, who had cried as they left,\nrevived in the clear wind and water.\nThey frolicked and laughed with great joy,\nSplashing and swimming upstream.\nSeeing this, I was relieved\nand returned along the river.\nSo told little Okikirmui.\n\nThis is the English Translation 2.\nKutsunisa Kutonkuton,\n\nOne day, as I wandered to the source of the water,\nI saw a small boy, hunched over,\nTrying to build a weir of walnut wood, driving piles.\nHe saw me and said:\n\"Who are you? Could you be my nephew? Give me a hand.\"\nI looked, and it was a weir of walnut,\nAnd the water of the walnut, a muddy torrent,\nThe salmon tried to swim upstream, but hated the walnut water,\nCrying, they turned back. My anger flared,\nI snatched the mallet from the boy's hand,\nAnd struck his waist with a mighty blow,\nThe sound like thunder. I broke the boy's\nSpine, killing him,\nAnd kicked him into hell. I shook\nThe walnut pile, as if to reach the sixth level of hell.\n\nThen, I used all my strength, all my power,\nTo break the pile from its roots,\nAnd kicked it into hell. \nA clear breeze came to the source of the water, the water flowed clear,\nThe salmon no longer cried,\nRegained their vitality, rejoiced, and played,\nSplashing water,\nSwimming upstream. Seeing this, my heart was comforted,\nAnd I returned along the stream. So spoke Little Okikirmui.\n",
