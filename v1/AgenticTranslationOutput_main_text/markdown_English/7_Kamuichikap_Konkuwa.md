梟の神が自ら歌った謡
         「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
昔私の物言う時は桜皮を巻いた弓の
弓把きゅうはの央を鳴り渡らす如くに
言ったのであったが,
今は衰え年老いてしまった事よ.
けれども誰か雄弁で
使者としての自信を持ってる者があったら,
天国へ五ツ半の談判
を言いつけてやりたいものだ.」と
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
私は言った,ところが入口で誰かが
「私をおいて誰が使者として雄弁で
自信のあるものがあるでしょう.」というので
見ると鴉からすの若者であった.
私は家に入れて,それから,たがつきのシントコの
蓋の上をたたきながら
鴉の若者を使者にたてる為
その談判を云いきかせて三日たって
三つ目の談判を話しながら見ると
鴉の若者は炉縁の後で
居眠りをしている,それを見ると,癪しゃくに
さわったので鴉の若者を
羽ぐるみ引っぱたいて殺してしまった.
それから又たがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら
「誰か使者として自信のある者が
あれば天国へ五ツ半の
談判を言いつけてやりたい.」と
言うと,誰かがまた入口へ
「誰が私をおいて,雄弁で
天国へ使者に立つほどの者がありましょう.」
と言うので見ると山のかけす
であった.
家へ入れてそれからまた
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の談判を話して
四日たって,四つの用向を言っているうちに
山のかけすは炉縁の後で居眠りをしている.
私は腹が立って山のかけすを羽ぐるみひっぱたいて
殺してしまった.
それからまたたがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら,
「誰か雄弁で使者として
自信のある者があれば,天国へ
五ツ半の談判を持たせてやりたい.」
と言うと,誰かが
慎つつしみ深い態度ではいって来たので見ると
川ガラスの若者,美しい様子で
左の座に坐った.それで私は
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の用件を夜でも
昼でも言い続けた.見れば
川ガラスの若者,何も疲れた様子もなく
聞いていて昼と夜を
数えて六日目に
私が言い終ると直ぐに天窗から
出て天国へ行ってしまった.
その談判の大むねは,人間の世界に
饑饉があって人間たちは今にも
餓死しようとしている.どういう訳かと
見ると天国に
鹿を司つかさどる神様と魚を司る神様とが
相談をして鹿も出さず魚も出さぬことに
したからであったので,神様たちから
どんなに言われても知らぬ顔をして
いるので人間たちは猟に
山へ行っても鹿も無い,魚漁に
川へ行っても魚も無い.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
鹿の神,魚の神へ使者をたてた
のである.
それから幾日もたって
空の方に微かな音がきこえていたが
誰かがはいって来た.見ると
川ガラスの若者,今は前よりも美しさを増し
勇ましい気品をそなえて
返し談判を述べはじめた.
天国の鹿の神や魚の神が
今日まで鹿を出さず魚を出さなかった
理由は,人間たちが鹿を捕る時に
木で鹿の頭をたたき,皮を剥ぐと
鹿の頭をそのまま山の木原に
捨ておき,魚をとると
腐れ木で魚の頭をたたいて殺すので,
鹿どもは,裸で泣きながら
鹿の神の許もとへ帰り,魚どもは
腐れ木をくわえて魚の神の
許へ帰る.鹿の神,魚の神は
怒って相談をし,鹿を出さず
魚を出さなかったのであった.がこののち
人間たちが鹿でも魚でも
ていねいに取扱うという事なら鹿も出す
魚も出すであろう,と鹿の神と
魚の神が言ったという事を詳しく申し立てた.
私はそれを聞いてから川ガラスの若者に
讃辞を呈して,見ると本当に
人間たちは鹿や魚を
粗末に取扱ったのであった.
それから,以後は,決してそんな事をしない様に
人間たちに,眠りの時,夢の中に
教えてやったら,人間たちも
悪かったという事に気が付き,それからは
幣ぬさの様に魚をとる道具を美しく作り
それで魚をとる.鹿をとったときは,鹿の頭も
きれいに飾って祭る,それで
魚たちは,よろこんで美しい御幣ごへいをくわえて
魚の神のもとに行き,鹿たちは
よろこんで新しく月代さかやきをして鹿の神
のもとに立ち帰る.それを鹿の神や
魚の神はよろこんで
沢山,魚を出し,沢山,鹿を出した.
人間たちは,今はもうなんの困る事も
ひもじい事もなく暮している,
私はそれを見て安心をした.
私は,もう年老い,衰え弱った
ので,天国へ行こうと
思っていたのだけれども,私が守護している人間の国に
饑饉があって人間たちが餓死しようとしているのに
構わずに行く事が出来ないので,
これまで居たのだけれども,今はもう
なんの気がかりも無いから,最も強い者
若い勇者を私のあとにおき人間の世を
守護させて,今天国へ行く所なのだ.
と,国の守護神なる翁神(梟)が
物語って天国へ行きました.と.

This is the English Translation 1.
"Konkuwa,"
In the old days, when I spoke, it was like the twang of a cherry-bark-wrapped bow,
The sound echoing from the center of the bow-grip.
But now, I have weakened and grown old.
Yet, if there were someone eloquent,
Someone confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a mission to Heaven, a negotiation of five and a half matters."
So I said, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko.
Then, at the entrance, someone said,
"Who but I is eloquent and confident enough to be a messenger?"
And when I looked, it was a young crow.
I let him into the house, and then, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
To appoint the young crow as my messenger,
I told him the details of the negotiation.
Three days passed, and as I spoke of the third matter,
The young crow was dozing behind the hearth.
Seeing this, I was enraged, and I struck the young crow,
Feathers and all, and killed him.
Then again, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
"If there is anyone confident enough to be a messenger,
I would entrust them with a mission to Heaven,
a negotiation of five and a half matters."
As I said this, someone again at the entrance said,
"Who but I is eloquent enough,
To stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
And when I looked, it was a mountain jay.
I let him into the house, and then again,
Tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
I spoke of the five and a half matters.
Four days passed, and as I spoke of the fourth matter,
The mountain jay was dozing behind the hearth.
I was angered, and I struck the mountain jay, feathers and all,
And killed him.
Then again, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a mission to Heaven,
a negotiation of five and a half matters."
As I said this, someone entered with
A respectful demeanor, and when I looked,
It was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance,
Who sat on the left side. And so I,
Tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko,
Continued to speak of the five and a half matters,
Night and day. And when I looked,
The young river crow showed no sign of fatigue,
Listening, and counting the days and nights,
On the sixth day, as soon as I finished speaking,
He went straight out through the skylight,
And departed for Heaven.
The gist of the negotiation was this:
There was a famine in the human world,
And the humans were on the verge of starvation.
The reason, it seemed,
Was that the god who governs the deer in Heaven,
And the god who governs the fish,
had consulted and decided to withhold both deer and fish.
No matter what was said to them, they feigned ignorance,
So the humans, when they went to the mountains to hunt,
Found no deer, and when they went to the rivers to fish,
Found no fish.
I was angered by this, and so,
I sent a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.
Many days passed,
And a faint sound could be heard in the sky,
Then someone entered. When I looked,
It was the young river crow, now even more beautiful,
Adorned with valiant dignity,
And he began to deliver the counter-negotiation.
The reason the deer god and the fish god of Heaven
Had withheld the deer and the fish until today,
Was that when the humans caught deer,
They struck the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,
They left the deer's head as it was in the mountain fields.
And when they caught fish,
They struck the fish's head with rotten wood to kill it.
So the deer, naked and weeping,
Returned to the deer god's presence, and the fish,
Holding the rotten wood in their mouths,
Returned to the fish god's presence. The deer god and the fish god,
Angered, consulted and withheld the deer
And the fish. But if from now on,
The humans would treat both deer and fish
With care, then they would release the deer
And release the fish, so the deer god and
The fish god had said, he reported in detail.
After hearing this, I offered praise to the young river crow,
And saw that indeed,
The humans had treated the deer and the fish
Carelessly. From then on, so as to never do such a thing again,
I taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,
And the humans realized their wrongdoings, and from then on,
They beautifully crafted tools for catching fish, like Nusa,
And used them to catch fish. When they caught deer, they also
Beautifully decorated and worshipped the deer's head. And so,
The fish, rejoicing, carried the beautiful Nusa in their mouths,
And went to the fish god's presence, and the deer,
Rejoicing, freshly shaved their forelocks, and returned
To the deer god's presence. The deer god and
The fish god rejoiced at this,
And released many fish, and released many deer.
The humans now lived without any hardship
Or hunger,
And I was relieved to see this.
I am now old, weakened, and frail,
And I had intended to go to Heaven,
But because there was a famine in the human land that I protect,
And the humans were on the verge of starvation, I could not
Go without concern, and so,
I have remained until now, but now there is no
Cause for worry, so I will place the strongest,
A young hero, in my stead to protect the human world,
And now I shall depart for Heaven."
So spoke the old god (the owl), guardian of the land,
And departed for Heaven.

This is the English Translation 2.
Long ago, I remember, my bow was wrapped with cherry bark.
When I drew it, the sound echoed through the lands.
But now, I am old, my strength and divine power waning.
Yet, if there be an eloquent one,
One who believes they can be my messenger,
I would send them to the heavens to negotiate the matter of Five and a Half."

So I spoke, striking the lid of the decorated shintoko.
Suddenly, I heard a voice outside the door:
"Who but I could be the eloquent messenger,
With a heart full of confidence, to journey to the heavens?"

I looked and saw a young crow.
I invited him in, and again struck the lid of the decorated shintoko,
Intending to send the young crow as my envoy.
I carefully explained the negotiations to him, over three days.

On the third day, as I described the third key point,
I saw the young crow, fast asleep by the hearth.
Seeing this, my anger flared,
And I struck down the young crow, feathers and wings and all.

Again, I struck the lid of the decorated shintoko,
"Who believes they can be my messenger,
I would send them to the heavens to negotiate the matter of Five and a Half."

Suddenly, I heard another voice outside the door:
"Who but I, with eloquence overflowing,
Could be an envoy to the heavens?"

I looked and saw a mountain jay.
I invited him in, and again struck the lid of the decorated shintoko,
And gently explained the negotiations of Five and a Half.

For four days, as I described the fourth crucial matter,
I saw the mountain jay, sound asleep by the hearth.
My anger was uncontrollable, and I struck down the mountain jay, feathers and wings and all.

Again, I struck the lid of the decorated shintoko,
"Who is eloquent, who believes they can be my messenger,
I would send them to the heavens to negotiate the matter of Five and a Half."

Suddenly, someone entered the room with a respectful air.
I looked and saw a young river otter, handsome and graceful,
Sitting upright on the left side. So I struck the lid of the decorated shintoko,
And explained the crucial matter of Five and a Half, day and night, repeatedly.

But the young river otter showed no sign of weariness,
Listening attentively, as day turned into night.
On the sixth day, when I had finally finished speaking,
He immediately burst through the skylight and departed for the heavens.

The main point of the negotiation was that in the human world,
Famine raged, the people suffered, and the fields were littered with corpses.
The reason for this was that in the heavens,
The god of deer and the god of fish,
Conspired to withhold both deer and fish.

No matter how the humans pleaded, they turned a deaf ear.
So when humans hunted in the mountains, they found no deer;
When they fished in the rivers, they caught no fish.

Seeing this, my anger flared,
And I sent a messenger to negotiate with the deer god and the fish god.

After several days, a faint sound came from the sky,
And suddenly someone entered the room. I looked,
And it was the young river otter, now even more so than before,
Handsome and graceful, with a noble bearing,
And he began to present the reply to the negotiation.

The deer god and the fish god of the heavens said:
"The reason we have not released deer or fish until now,
Is because when humans hunt deer,
They strike the deer's head with wood, skin it,
And carelessly discard the deer's head in the forests.

When they catch fish, they kill them by striking their heads with rotten wood.
So the deer herds, naked and weeping,
Return to the deer god; the fish schools, carrying rotten wood in their mouths,
Return to the fish god. The deer god and the fish god were enraged,
And conspired to withhold both deer and fish.

But if humans from now on,
Treat deer and fish with kindness, then deer can be released, and fish can be released."
So said the deer god and the fish god.

Hearing this, I offered praise to the young river otter.
Only then did I realize that humans had indeed treated deer and fish cruelly.

From then on, when I slept in the human world,
I warned them in dreams not to do so again.
The humans also knew their mistake, and so with gifts of cloth,
And finely crafted fishing and hunting tools, they fished and hunted.

When hunting deer, they also carefully decorated the deer's head and offered it in sacrifice.
So the fish schools rejoiced, carrying beautiful offerings,
To the fish god; the deer herds rejoiced,
Adorning themselves with new moon ornaments, and returned to the deer god.

The deer god and the fish god, seeing this, were greatly pleased,
And sent down countless fish, and sent down countless deer.
From then on, the human world was free from hardship and hunger,
Living in peace and prosperity. Seeing this, I was greatly relieved.

I am old and weak, and originally intended to go to the heavens,
But the human realm I protect,
Was in the midst of famine, the people suffering, and the fields littered with corpses,
So I dared not leave without permission, and only now am I at ease.

Now I have no more worries, so I wish to choose the strongest,
A young warrior, to succeed me and protect the human world.
Now I will depart for the heavens.

Thus, the guardian god of the land, the old god (owl),
Finished speaking, and departed for the heavens.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4.5 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is generally accurate but sometimes feels a bit literal and lacks the poetic flow expected of a chant. Some phrases are slightly awkward.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is more poetic and flows better. It captures the spirit of the original text more effectively. The choice of 'river otter' is more accurate.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the essence and flow of the original Japanese text more effectively. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 2 uses slightly more evocative language and maintains a better sense of rhythm, making it more suitable for a chant. It also avoids some of the slightly awkward phrasing present in Translation 1. The use of "river otter" instead of "river crow" is more accurate.

Long ago, I remember, my bow was wrapped with cherry bark.

But now, I am old, my strength and divine power waning.
