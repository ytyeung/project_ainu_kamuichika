谷地の魔神が自ら歌った謡「ハリツ クンナ」

ハリツ クンナ
ある日に好いお天気なので
私の谷地に眼と口とだけ
出して見ていたところが
ずっと浜の方から人の話し声がきこえて来た.
見ると,二人の若者が連れだって来た.
先に来た者は勇者らしく勇者の品を
そなえて,神の様に美しいが
後から来た者を見ると,様子の悪い
顔色の悪い男で,何か話し合いながら
やって来たが私の谷地の側を通り
ちょうど私の前へ来ると,あとから来た顔色の悪い男が
立ち止り立ち止り自分の鼻をおおい
「おお臭い,いやな谷地,悪い谷地の前を通ったら
まあ汚い,何だろうこんなに臭いのは.」
と言った.
私はただ聞いたばかりだけれど自分の居るか居ないかも
わからぬほど腹が立った.
泥の中から飛び出した.私が飛び上ると
地が裂け地が破れる.牙を
鳴らしながら,彼等を強く追っかけたところが
先に来た者は,それと見るや
魚がクルリとあとへかえる様に引っかえして顔色の悪い男の
わきの下をくぐりずーっと逃げてしまった.
青い男を二間三間追っかけると
直ぐ追いついて頭から呑んでしまった.
そこで今度は彼かの男をありったけの速力で追っかけて来て
人間の村,大きな村の後へ着いた.
見るとむこうから
火の老女,神の老女があかい着物,六枚の着物に
帯をしめ,六枚の着物を羽織って
あかい杖をついて私の側へ飛んで来た.
「これはこれは,お前は何しにこのアイヌ村へ
来るのか,さあお帰り,さあお帰り.」
言いながら,あかい杖,かねの杖をふり上げて私を
たたくと,杖から焔が
私の上へ雨の様に降って来る.
けれども私はちっとも構わず,
牙打ち鳴らしながら彼の男を
追っかけると,彼の男は村の中を
よくまわる環の様に走って行く.そのあとを飛んで
行くと,大地が裂け大地が破れる.村中は大さわぎ
妻の手を引く者,子の手を引く者,泣き叫び
逃げゆくもの,煮えくりかえるようなありさま,けれども
私は少しも構わず,土吹雪
をたてる,火の老女神は私の側を走って来ると
大へんな焔が,私の上に飛び交う.
その中に,彼の男は一軒の家に
飛び込むと直ぐにまた飛び出した.
見ると,蓬の小弓に蓬の小矢をつがえて
むこうから,ニコニコして,私をねらっている.
それを見て私は可笑しく思った.
「あんな小さな蓬の矢,何で人が苦しむものか.」と
思いながら私は牙を打ち鳴らして,
頭から呑もうとしたら
その時彼の男は私の首ッ玉を
したたかに射た.それっきりどうしたか
わからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たところが
大きな竜の耳と耳の間に私はいた.
村の人々が集って,彼かの私が追っかけた若者が
大声で指図さしずをして,私の屍体をみんな細かに刻み
一つ所へ運んで焼いてその灰を
山の岩の岩の後へ捨ててしまった.
今になってはじめて見ると,それは,ただの人間
ただの若者だと思ったのは
オキキリムイ,神の勇者であった.
恐しい悪い神,悪魔神,私はそれであって
人間の村の近くにいるので,
オキキリムイは村の為を思って,私をおこらせ
自分を追いかけさせて,蓬の矢で私を殺したので
あった.それから,先に私が呑んでしまった
青い男は,人間だと思ったのだったが
それは,オキキリムイがその放糞を人に作り,
それを連れて来たのであった.
私は魔神であったから今はもう
地獄のおそろしい悪い国にやられたのだから
これからは,人間の国には,なんの危険も
ない,邪魔ものもないであろう.
私は恐しい魔神であったけれども,
一人の人間の計略にまけて
今はもう,つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
と谷地の魔神が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Harits Kunna

One day, the weather being fair,
I merely peeked out from my mire bog,
Only my eyes and mouth showing.
From the direction of the shore,
I heard the voices of men.
I saw two young men approaching together.

The first seemed a hero,
bearing the marks of courage,
as beautiful as a god.
But the one who followed behind
was a sorry sight,
a man of ill complexion.
They came along discussing something,
and as they passed by my mire bog,
right before me, the pale-faced man stopped.
He paused, covering his nose.
"Oh, how foul! This wretched bog! Passing by this vile mire,
what is this filth, this stench?"
he exclaimed.

I merely heard his words,
but rage swelled within me,
so much that I forgot myself.
I burst forth from the mud.
As I leaped, the earth cracked and split.
Gnashing my fangs, I fiercely pursued them.

The first man, seeing this,
turned back as swiftly as a fish,
ducking under the pale man's arm
and fleeing far away.
I chased the blue-faced man a few steps,
quickly overtaking him and swallowing him whole.

Then, with all my speed, I pursued the other,
reaching the edge of a human village,
a large settlement.
There I saw,
coming towards me,
a fire old woman, a divine crone,
in red robes, six layers bound
with a sash, six layers draped,
leaning on a red staff, flying to my side.

"Well now, what brings you to this Ainu village?
Be gone! Be gone!"
she cried, raising her red staff,
a staff of metal, and striking me.
From the staff, flames rained down upon me.

Yet I paid no heed,
gnashing my fangs as I chased the man.
He ran through the village like a wheel turning,
and I flew after him, causing the earth to crack and split.
The village was in uproar,
some pulling their wives by the hand,
some pulling their children, crying out,
fleeing in disarray, a scene of chaos.

But I cared not,
raising a storm of dust.
The fire goddess ran beside me,
and great flames flew about me.

Then, the man darted into a house,
only to emerge again at once.
I saw him nocking a small arrow of mugwort
to a small bow of mugwort,
smiling as he aimed at me.

Seeing this, I found it amusing.
"How could anyone suffer from such a tiny mugwort arrow?"
I thought, gnashing my fangs,
and I lunged to swallow him whole.

At that moment, the man struck my head
with a mighty shot. After that, I knew nothing.
When I came to my senses,
I was between the ears of a great dragon.

The villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased,
Okikirmui, directed them in a loud voice.
They cut my corpse into tiny pieces,
gathered them in one place, burned them,
and scattered the ashes behind the rocks of the mountain.

Only now do I see that he was no mere human,
no mere youth.
He was Okikirmui, a divine hero.
A terrible, evil god, a demon god was I,
and because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui, thinking of the village's welfare,
angered me, made me chase him,
and killed me with his mugwort arrow.

And the blue-faced man I swallowed,
I thought he was a human,
but he was merely a creation of Okikirmui's excrement,
whom he had brought along.

I was a demon, and now I am cast
into the terrible, evil land of hell.
From now on, there will be no danger,
no disturbance in the land of humans.
I was a fearsome demon,
but I was defeated by the cunning of a single man,
and now I meet a meaningless, wretched death.

So spoke the mire bog demon.

This is the English Translation 2.
Hallec Kunna,

One day, the sky was clear and bright.
I peered out, just my eyes and mouth,
Watching over my marshland domain.
From the distant shore, voices carried on the breeze.
I saw two young men approaching side by side.

The one in the lead, a hero it seemed,
bearing the aura of a valiant warrior,
as handsome as a god.
Behind him, a man with a weary face and pallid complexion.
They walked and talked, passing by my marsh,
coming right before me. The sickly man
stumbled to a halt, pinching his nose.
He exclaimed, "Ah, how foul! This wretched swamp,
to pass through such filth,
what vile stench is this?"

I listened, my rage ignited, nearly forgetting myself.
I burst forth from the mire, and as I rose,
the earth cracked and crumbled. I roared,
fiercely chasing after them.
The leader, seeing this, swiftly
turned like a fish, darting under the arm
of his ill companion, fleeing with all his might.

I pursued the pale-faced man for a few steps,
quickly catching up, and devoured him whole.
Then, with all my strength, I chased after the one who fled,
reaching a human village, a vast settlement.
There, coming towards me,
was the old fire woman, the divine crone, adorned in red,
six layers of robes,
her waist cinched tight, draped in six layers,
leaning on a red staff, rushing towards me.

"Halt, halt! Why do you come to this Ainu village?
Return, return!"
She cried, raising her red staff, her golden staff, striking me
with it, flames erupting,
raining down upon me.
But I remained unmoved,
roaring, continuing my pursuit of the man.

He ran through the village,
spinning like a wheel. I followed relentlessly,
the earth splitting and collapsing. Chaos erupted in the village,
people grabbing their wives' hands, their children's hands, crying out
as they scattered, a scene of pandemonium.
But I paid no heed, raising clouds of dust.
The fire goddess rushed towards me,
giant flames dancing around me.

In the midst of the turmoil, the man darted into a house,
and then emerged once more.
He held a small bow made of mugwort, notched with an arrow of mugwort,
smiling, aiming at me.
Seeing this, I scoffed.
"Such a tiny mugwort arrow, how could it harm me?"
I thought, roaring,
about to swallow him whole,
when the man struck me hard in the neck.
From that moment, I lost consciousness.

When I awoke again,
I found myself between the ears of a giant dragon.
The villagers gathered, the young man I had chased
loudly commanding, chopping my corpse into pieces,
transporting it to a place of burning, casting the ashes
behind the mountain rocks.

Now I understand, the one I thought was merely human,
a simple young man,
was in truth Okikirmui, the divine hero.
I was the terrible evil god, the demon god, because I dwelled
near the human village,
Okikirmui deliberately provoked me, causing me
to chase him, and then killed me with a mugwort arrow.

And the pale-faced man I swallowed,
whom I thought was human,
was but a doll created by Okikirmui from his own excrement,
and brought along.
I, a demon god, have now been cast into
the terrible, wicked realm of hell.
From now on, the human realm will be free from danger,
free from obstruction.

Though I am a fearsome demon god,
I was defeated by the cunning of a human,
and now I die a pathetic, insignificant death.

Thus spoke the demon of the marsh.
