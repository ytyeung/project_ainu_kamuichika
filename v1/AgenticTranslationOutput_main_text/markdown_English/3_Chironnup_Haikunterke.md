狐が自ら歌った謡
「ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ」

ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ
国の岬,神の岬の上に
私は坐して居りました.
ある日に外へ出て見ますと
海は凪なぎてひろびろとしていて,海の上に
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカとサマユンクルが
海猟に三人乗りで出かけています,それを見た私は
私の持ってる悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上をずーっと上へずーっと下へ
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけ出しました.
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパーウ,パウと叫び
この川の水源をにらみにらみ暴風の魔を
呼びました.すると,それにつれてこの川の
水源から烈しい風,つむじ風が
吹き出して海にはいると直ぐに
この海は,上の海が下になり
下の海が上になりました.オキキリムイたち
の漁舟は沖の人の海と,陸の人の海との
出会ったところ(海の中程)に,非常な急変に会って波の間を
クルリと廻りました.大きな浪が山の様に
舟の上へかぶさり寄ります.すると,
オキキリムイ,サマユンクル,シュプンラムカは
声をふるって,舟を漕ぎました.
この小さい舟は落葉の飛ぶ様に吹き飛ばされ
今にもくつがえりそうになるけれども
感心にも人間たちは力強くて
この小舟は風の中に
波の上をすべります.
それを見ると私の持っている悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり,
重い調子で木片がポキリポキリと折れる様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔を声援するのみに精を出しました.
そうしてる中に,やっと,サマユンクルが
手の上から,手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれました.
そのさまを見て私はひそかに笑いを浮べました.
それからまた,精を出して
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
暴風の魔を声援しました.
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカと二人で
励まし合いながら勇ましく舟を漕いで
居りましたが,と,ある時シュプンラムカは
手の上から手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれてしまいました,それを見て
ひそかに私は笑いました.
それからまた軽い足取りで腰やわらかに
飛びまわり重い調子でかたい木片を
ポキリポキリと折る様に叫び精を出しました.
けれども,オキキリムイは疲れた様子は少しも無い.
一枚の薄物を体にまとい,
舟を漕いでいます,そのうちに
手の下でその持っていた楫、が折れてしまいました.
すると,疲れ死んだサマユンクルに
躍りかかりその持っている楫、をもぎとってたった一人で
舟を漕ぎました.
私はそれを見ると,持前の悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
重い調子でかたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
精を出して暴風の魔に声援しました.
そうしてるうちにサマユンクルの舵も
折れてしまいました.オキキリムイはシュプンラムカに
躍りかかりその楫をとって
勇ましく舟を漕ぎました.
けれども彼の楫も波に折られてしまいました.
そこで,オキキリムイは舟の中に
立ちつくして,烈しい風のうちに
まさか人間の彼が私を見つけようとは
思わなかったに,国の岬,神の岬の
上の,私の眼の央を見つめました.
今までやさしかった顔に怒りの色を
あらわして,鞄をいじっていたが
中から出したものを見ると,蓬よもぎの小弓と
蓬の小矢を取り出しました.
それを見てひそかに私は笑いました.
「人間なぞ何をしたって,恐い事があるものか,
あんな蓬の小矢は何に使うものだろう.」
と思ってこの岬
国の岬,神の岬の上を
ずーっと上へずーっと下へ軽い足取りで
腰やわらかにかけまわり,重い調子で
かたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔をほめたたえました.
その中にオキキリムイの射放した矢が飛んで来ましたが
ちょうど私の襟首えりくびのところへ突きささりました.
それっきりあとどうなったか解らなくなってしまいました.
ふと気がついて見ると
大そう好いお天気で,海の上は
広々として,オキキリムイの漁舟もなにもありません.
どうした事か私の頭のさきから
足のさきまで雁皮が燃え縮む様に痛みます.
まさか人間の射た小さな矢がこんなに私を苦しめ
ようとは思わなかったのに,それから手足をもがき苦しみ
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上を,ずーっと上へ,ずーっと下へ泣き叫びながら
もがき苦しみ,昼でも夜でも生きたり
死んだり,している中に,どうしたか
わからなくなりました.
ふと気がついて見ると,
大きな黒狐の耳と耳との間に私は居りました.
二日ほどたった時,オキキリムイが神様の様な様子で
やって来て,ニコニコ笑って言うことには,
「まあ見ばのよい事,国の岬,神の岬
の上を見守る黒狐の神様は,
善い心,神の心を持っていたから
死にざまの見ばのよい死方をしたのですね.」
言いながら私の頭を取って,
自分の家へ持って行き私の上顎の骨を
自分の便所のどだいとし,私の下顎を
その妻の便所の礎として,
私のからだはそのまま土と共に腐ってしまいました.
それから夜でも昼でも
悪い臭気に苦しんでいる中に私はつまらない死方,悪い
死方をしました.
ただの身分の軽い神でもなかったのですが
大変な悪い心を私は持っていた為なんにも
ならない,悪い死方を私はしたのですから
これからの狐たちよ,決して
悪い心を持ちなさるな.

と狐の神様が物語りました.

The Fox's Own Song:
"Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat in my place.
One day, I ventured out to look,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunkamui, and Samayunkur
Set out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this,
The wicked thoughts within me stirred.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, I ran with light steps and a supple waist.
With heavy rhythm, as if snapping wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
And glared at the source of the river, summoning the demon of storms.
Then, from the river's source,
A fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Burst forth and rushed into the sea, and at once
The upper sea became the lower, and the lower the upper.
Okikirmui's fishing boat,
Met with a sudden change where the sea of offshore people and the sea of land people met (mid-sea),
And spun around in the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed over the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, Shupunkamui
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown like a falling leaf,
And though it seemed about to capsize,
Admirably, the humans were strong,
And the small boat glided through the wind,
Over the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
With heavy rhythm, as if snapping wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
And devoted myself to cheering on the demon of storms.
As I did so, at last, Samayunkur
Bled from his hands, from above and below,
And collapsed in exhaustion.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I exerted myself,
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
With heavy rhythm, as if snapping wood, I cried,
Cheering on the demon of storms.
Okikirmui and Shupunkamui, the two of them,
Encouraged each other and bravely rowed the boat,
But then, at one moment, Shupunkamui
Bled from his hands, from above and below,
And collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps and a supple waist,
I leaped about, with heavy rhythm, as if snapping hard wood,
I cried, exerting myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a single thin garment wrapped around his body,
He rowed the boat, until,
In his hands, the oar he held snapped.
Then, he leaped upon the exhausted Samayunkur
Tore away the oar he held, and rowed the boat alone.
When I saw this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With heavy rhythm, as if snapping hard wood, I cried,
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
Exerting myself, cheering on the demon of storms.
As I did so, Samayunkur's rudder also
Snapped. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunkamui
Took his oar,
And bravely rowed the boat.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the fierce wind,
Never imagining that a human like him could find me,
He gazed into the center of my eyes, upon
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His face, once gentle, now showed anger,
He fiddled with a bag,
And took out from within a small mugwort bow
And a small mugwort arrow.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
"What can humans do? Is there anything to fear?
What use is such a mugwort arrow?"
Thinking this, upon this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, I ran with light steps
And a supple waist, with heavy rhythm,
As if snapping hard wood, I cried, "Pau, pau!"
Praising the demon of storms.
In the midst of this, the arrow shot by Okikirmui came flying,
And pierced me right at the nape of my neck.
After that, I no longer knew what happened.
When I came to, I found
The weather was very fine, and the sea was
Vast, and there was no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it ached as if bark was burning and shrinking.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so,
Then, writhing in agony, I struggled with my hands and feet,
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, crying and screaming,
Writhing in agony, living and
Dying, day and night, until I no longer knew
What had become of me.
When I came to, I found myself
Between the ears of a large black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui came in the guise of a god,
Smiling and saying,
"How beautiful! The black fox god who watches over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Possessed a good heart, a divine heart,
And so died a beautiful death."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the cornerstone of his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
Then, night and day,
Suffering from a foul stench, I died a meaningless, bad
Death.
Though I was not merely a god of low rank,
Because I possessed a terribly wicked heart, I died a useless,
Bad death. Therefore,
Foxes of the future, never
Hold a wicked heart."

So the fox god told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
Haikunteleke Haikoshitemturi

I once sat upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
One day, I emerged from my cave and gazed afar,
The sea was calm, vast and boundless. Upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur
Sailed together in a boat, hunting at sea. Witnessing this,
Evil thoughts surged within me like the rising tide.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I ran back and forth with nimble steps and a supple waist,
Heavily uttering cries of "Pau, Pau," like the sound of snapping wood,
I glared at the river's source, summoning the magic of the storm.
In response, from the river's source,
A gale howled, a tornado arose, striking the sea,
In an instant, the ocean churned, turning upside down.
Okikirmui and his companions' fishing boat, at the meeting point of the near and far seas,
Encountered a sudden upheaval, spinning in the waves.
The giant waves crashed down like mountains.
Thus,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka
Shouted with all their might, paddling desperately.
The small boat, like a fallen leaf, was tossed by the gale,
On the verge of capsizing,
But admirable were the people, full of strength,
The small boat sailed on the wind,
Gliding on the waves.
Seeing this, evil thoughts surged within me once more.
I ran back and forth with nimble steps and a supple waist,
Heavily uttering cries of "Pau, Pau," like the sound of snapping wood,
I shouted with all my might, cheering on the magic of the storm.
Amidst this turmoil, finally, Samayunkur
His hands bleeding profusely,
Collapsed, exhausted.
Seeing him in this state, I chuckled to myself.
Then, I exerted myself even more,
Running back and forth with nimble steps and a supple waist,
Heavily uttering cries like the sound of snapping wood,
Cheering on the magic of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka encouraged each other,
Bravely rowing the boat,
Suddenly, Shupunramka
His hands bleeding profusely,
Collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,
I chuckled to myself.
Then, I ran back and forth,
Jumping, heavily uttering cries like the sound of snapping hard wood, exerting all my strength.
However, Okikirmui showed no signs of fatigue.
He wore a thin garment,
Paddling the boat, and soon,
The oar in his hand snapped.
So, he lunged towards the already exhausted Samayunkur,
Seized the oar from his hands, and alone,
Paddled the boat.
Seeing this, the inherent evil thoughts within me surged again.
I heavily uttered cries like the sound of snapping hard wood,
Running back and forth with nimble steps and a supple waist,
Exerting all my strength, cheering on the magic of the storm.
Amidst this turmoil, Samayunkur's rudder
Also broke. Okikirmui lunged towards Shupunramka,
Seized his oar,
Bravely paddling the boat.
However, his oar was also broken by the waves.
So, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the gale,
Never did he imagine that he, a human, could discover me, above the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
He gazed into my eyes.
His originally gentle face revealed an expression of anger,
He fiddled with a pouch,
From which he took a small bow made of mugwort and
A small arrow made of mugwort.
Seeing these, I chuckled to myself.
"What can humans do? What is there to fear?
What use is that small arrow made of mugwort?"
Thinking this, on this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I ran back and forth with nimble steps and a supple waist, heavily
Uttering cries of "Pau, Pau," like the sound of snapping hard wood,
Praising the magic of the storm.
Amidst this clamor, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
Striking my collar.
From then on, I knew nothing more.
Suddenly regaining consciousness,
The weather was clear,
The sea was vast, and Okikirmui's fishing boat was nowhere to be seen.
What had happened? From the top of my head to
My toes, it burned like burning daphne bark.
Never did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so, so I struggled with my hands and feet, in agony,
On this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I cried out,
Struggling, in agony, day and night, sometimes alive,
Sometimes dead, in this state, I lost consciousness.
Suddenly regaining consciousness,
I found myself between the ears of a giant black fox.
About two days later, Okikirmui, in the guise of a god,
Came, smiling, and said,
"How beautiful, the black fox god guarding the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Because he possessed a kind heart, a god's heart,
He died so honorably."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it back to his home, using my upper jawbone
As the foundation for his toilet, and my lower jawbone
As the cornerstone for his wife's toilet,
My body rotted with the soil.
From then on, day and night,
I suffered from the stench, I died without value, I died miserably.
I was not merely a low-ranking god,
But because I harbored extremely evil thoughts, I met such an end.
So, from now on, foxes, never
Harbor evil thoughts.

The fox god tells it this way.
