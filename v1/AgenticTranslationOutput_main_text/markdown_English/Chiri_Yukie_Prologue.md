序

その昔この広い北海道は,私たちの先祖の自由の天地でありました.天真爛漫な稚児の様に,美しい大自然に抱擁されてのんびりと楽しく生活していた彼等は,真に自然の寵児,なんという幸福な人だちであったでしょう.
冬の陸には林野をおおう深雪を蹴って,天地を凍らす寒気を物ともせず山又山をふみ越えて熊を狩り,夏の海には涼風泳ぐみどりの波,白い鴎の歌を友に木の葉の様な小舟を浮べてひねもす魚を漁り,花咲く春は軟らかな陽の光を浴びて,永久に囀さえずる小鳥と共に歌い暮して蕗ふきとり蓬よもぎ摘み,紅葉の秋は野分に穂揃うすすきをわけて,宵まで鮭とる篝かがりも消え,谷間に友呼ぶ鹿の音を外に,円まどかな月に夢を結ぶ.嗚呼なんという楽しい生活でしょう.平和の境,それも今は昔,夢は破れて幾十年,この地は急速な変転をなし,山野は村に,村は町にと次第々々に開けてゆく.
太古ながらの自然の姿も何時の間にか影薄れて,野辺に山辺に嬉々として暮していた多くの民の行方も亦いずこ.僅かに残る私たち同族は,進みゆく世のさまにただ驚きの眼をみはるばかり.しかもその眼からは一挙一動宗教的感念に支配されていた昔の人の美しい魂の輝きは失われて,不安に充ち不平に燃え,鈍りくらんで行手も見わかず,よその御慈悲にすがらねばならぬ,あさましい姿,おお亡びゆくもの......それは今の私たちの名,なんという悲しい名前を私たちは持っているのでしょう.
その昔,幸福な私たちの先祖は,自分のこの郷土が末にこうした惨めなありさまに変ろうなどとは,露ほども想像し得なかったのでありましょう.
時は絶えず流れる,世は限りなく進展してゆく.激しい競争場裡に敗残の醜をさらしている今の私たちの中からも,いつかは,二人三人でも強いものが出て来たら,進みゆく世と歩をならべる日も,やがては来ましょう.それはほんとうに私たちの切なる望み,明暮あけくれ祈っている事で御座います.
けれど......愛する私たちの先祖が起伏す日頃互いに意を通ずる為に用いた多くの言語,言い古し,残し伝えた多くの美しい言葉,それらのものもみんな果敢なく,亡びゆく弱きものと共に消失せてしまうのでしょうか.おおそれはあまりにいたましい名残惜しい事で御座います.
アイヌに生れアイヌ語の中に生いたった私は,雨の宵,雪の夜,暇ある毎に打集って私たちの先祖が語り興じたいろいろな物語の中極く小さな話の一つ二つを拙ない筆に書連ねました.
私たちを知って下さる多くの方に読んでいただく事が出来ますならば,私は,私たちの同族祖先と共にほんとうに無限の喜び,無上の幸福に存じます.

大正十一年三月一日

知里幸惠

Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature and lived leisurely and happily. They were truly the darlings of nature, how fortunate they were. In the winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the land, braving the freezing cold, crossing mountains to hunt bears. In the summer, they floated in small, leaf-like boats on the green waves where cool breezes swam, with the songs of white gulls as companions, fishing all day long. In the blooming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, singing and living with birds that chirped eternally, picking butterburs and mugwort. In the autumn of red leaves, they parted the pampas grass with ears aligned in the autumn wind, the bonfires for catching salmon disappearing until late at night, and with the sound of deer calling to friends in the valley, they wove dreams in the round moon. Ah, what a joyful life it was. A peaceful realm, but now it is a thing of the past. Dreams have been shattered for decades, and this land has undergone rapid changes, with mountains and fields turning into villages, and villages gradually developing into towns. The ancient natural scenery has faded away unnoticed, and the whereabouts of many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains are also unknown. We, the few remaining members of our race, can only stare in astonishment at the advancing world. Moreover, the beautiful soul of the people of the past, who were controlled by religious ideas in every action, has been lost from those eyes, filled with anxiety and burning with discontent, dulled and unable to see the way forward, forced to rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our current name, what a sad name we have. In the past, our happy ancestors could not have imagined even in the slightest that their homeland would be reduced to such a miserable state. Time flows ceaselessly, and the world progresses infinitely. Even from among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of defeat in the fierce arena of competition, if two or three strong individuals emerge someday, the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our earnest desire, something we pray for day and night. But... will the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other in their daily lives, the many beautiful words that have been passed down, all disappear fruitlessly along with the dying weak? Oh, that is too painful and regrettable. Born as an Ainu and raised in the Ainu language, I have written down in clumsy strokes one or two of the very small stories from the various tales that our ancestors gathered and enjoyed on rainy evenings and snowy nights, whenever I had free time. If many people who know us can read this, I will feel truly infinite joy and supreme happiness together with our ancestors.

Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Embraced by beautiful nature like innocent children, they lived leisurely and happily, truly the darlings of nature, how fortunate they were! In winter, on land, they kicked away the thick snow covering the forests, braving the cold of the frozen world, crossing mountains to hunt bears. In summer, at sea, they were accompanied by the cool breeze on the blue waves and the songs of white gulls, floating on leaf-like boats, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they bathed in the gentle sunlight, singing with the ever-singing birds, picking butterburs and mugwort. In the autumn of red leaves, they parted the pampas grass, neatly headed and swayed by the wind, until night fell, and the bonfires for catching salmon had died out, in the valleys, accompanied by the calls of deer calling their companions, weaving dreams under the round moon. Ah, what a joyful life! A peaceful land, now all in the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone rapid changes, mountains and fields have become villages, villages have become towns, gradually being developed and cultivated. The natural scenery from ancient times has faded, and where have the many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? Only the remaining members of our tribe can only open our eyes in surprise at the ever-advancing world. And from those eyes, the beautiful spiritual light of the people, whose every move was once governed by religious beliefs, has disappeared, filled with anxiety, burning with dissatisfaction, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others, what a pitiful sight, ah, things that are about to perish... that is our name now, what a sad name we have! In the past, our happy ancestors could not have imagined that their homeland would eventually become so miserable. Time continues to flow, and the world develops and advances infinitely. In the fierce arena of competition, among us who are exposing the ugliness of defeat, one day, if two or three strong people can emerge and walk alongside the ever-advancing era, that day will eventually come. That is our urgent wish, that is what we pray for day and night. But... our beloved ancestors, the many languages they used to communicate with each other in daily life, the many beautiful words passed down from generation to generation, will those things also disappear mercilessly, along with the weak who are about to perish? Ah, that is too sad and regrettable. As an Ainu, raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights, on snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather together and record, with clumsy strokes, a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors. If it can be read by many people who understand us, I will feel truly infinite joy and supreme happiness, together with our ancestors. March 1, Taisho 11 Yukie Chiri
