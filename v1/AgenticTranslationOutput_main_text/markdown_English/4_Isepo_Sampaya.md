兎が自ら歌った謡「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら兄様のあとをしたって山へ行きました.
毎日毎日兄様のあとへ行って見ると
人間が弩いしゆみを仕掛けて置いてあるとその弩を兄様が
こわしてしまう,それを私は笑うのを
常としていたのでこの日また
行って見たら,ちっとも
思いがけない
兄様が弩にかかって泣き叫んでいる.
私はビックリして,兄様のそばへ
飛んで行ったら兄様は
泣きながら云うことには,
「これ弟よ,今これから
お前は走って行って
私たちの村の後へ着いたら
兄様が弩にかかったよ――,フオホホーイと
大声でよぶのだよ.」
私はきいて
ハイ,ハイ,と返辞をして,それから
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら来て
私たちの村の村後へ着きました.
そこではじめて兄様が私を使いによこしたことを
思い出しました,私は大声で叫び声を挙げようとした
が,兄様が何を言って私を使によこしてあったのか
すっかり私は忘れていました.そこに立ちつくして
思い出そうとしたがどうしてもだめだ.
それからまた
二つの谷を越え三つの谷を越え
後へ逆飛び逆躍びしながら
兄様のいる所へ来て
見ると誰もいない.
兄様の血だけがそこらに附いていた.
(ここまでで話は外へ飛ぶ)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
毎日毎日私は山へ行って
人間が弩を仕掛けてあるのをこわして
それを面白がるのが常であった所が
ある日また,前の所に弩が仕掛けて
あると,その側に小さい蓬よもぎの弩が
仕掛けてある,
私はそれを見ると
「こんな物,何にする物だろう.」
と思っておかしいので
ちょとそれに触って見た,直ぐに逃げようと
したら,思いがけ
なく,その弩にいやという程
はまってしまった.
逃げようともがけば
もがくほど,強くしめられるのでどうする事も
出来ないので,私は泣いて
いると,私の側へ何だか
飛んで来たので見るとそれは私の弟
であった.私はよろこんで,私たちの一族のものに
この事を知らせる様に言いつけてやったが
それからいくら待っても何の音もない.
私は泣いていると,私の側へ
人の影があらわれた.見ると,
神の様な美しい人間の若者
ニコニコして,私を取って,
どこかへ持って行った.見ると
大きな家の中が神の宝物で
一ぱいになっている.
彼かの若者は火を焚いて,
大きな鍋を火にかけて,掛けてある刀を引き抜いて
私のからだを皮のままブツブツに切って
鍋一ぱいに入れそれから鍋の下へ頭を突き入れ突き入れ
火を焚きつけ出した.どうかして
逃げたいので私は人間の若者の隙を
ねらうけれども,人間の若者はちっとも私から
眼をはなさない.
「鍋が煮え立って私が煮えてしまったら,なんにも
ならないつまらない死方,悪い死方をしなければならない.」と
思って人間の若者の油断を
ねらってねらって,やっとの事
一片の肉に自分を化かわらして
立ち上る湯気に身を交まじえて鍋の椽に
上り,左の座へ飛び下りると直ぐに
戸外へ飛び出した,泣きながら
飛んで息を切らして逃げて来て
私の家へ着いて
ほんとうにあぶないことであったと胸撫で下した.
後ふりかえって見ると,
ただの人間,ただの若者とばかり
思っていたのはオキキリムイ,神の様な強い方
なのでありました.
ただの人間が仕掛けた弩だと思って
毎日毎日悪戯をしたのをオキキリムイ
は大そう怒って蓬の小弩で
私を殺そうとしたのだが,私も
ただの身分の軽い神でもないのに,つまらない死方,悪い死方
をしたら,私の親類のもの共も,困り惑うであろう
事を不憫に思って下されて
おかげで,私が逃げても追いかけなかった
のでありました.
それから,前には,兎は
鹿ほども体の大きなものであったが,
この様な悪戯を私がしたために
オキキリムイの一つの肉片ほど小さくなったのです.
これからの私たちの仲間はみんなこの位の
からだになるのであろう.
これからの兎たちよ,決していたずらをしなさるな.
と,兎の首領が子供等を教えて死にました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Sanpaya Tereke
Across two valleys, leaping over three,
I followed my elder brother to the mountains, playing along the way.
Each day I went after my brother,
And saw that humans had set a crossbow trap. My brother would break these traps,
And I would laugh at this.
But on this day,
Unexpectedly,
My brother was caught in a crossbow, crying out in pain.
Startled, I flew to his side.
My brother, weeping, said to me,
'Oh, little brother, now you must run,
Go behind our village,
And shout loudly, "Brother is caught in a crossbow!" – Hohohoi!'
I listened and replied,
'Yes, yes,' and then,
Across two valleys, leaping over three,
I came playing to the rear of our village.
There, I finally remembered why my brother had sent me.
I tried to shout the message,
But I had completely forgotten what my brother had told me to say.
I stood there, trying to remember, but I couldn't.
Then again,
Across two valleys, over three,
I leaped and bounded back,
To where my brother was,
But he was gone.
Only his blood remained.
(Here the story shifts)
Ketoka woiwoi ketoka, ketoka woi ketoka
Every day I went to the mountains,
Destroying the crossbows that humans set,
Finding amusement in it.
But one day, at the usual place, a crossbow was set,
And beside it, a small crossbow made of mugwort.
Seeing it, I thought,
'What is this for?'
And, finding it funny, I touched it.
I tried to escape immediately,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in the crossbow, trapped completely.
The more I struggled,
The tighter it became, and I could do nothing.
I was crying,
When something flew to my side.
It was my younger brother.
I rejoiced and told him to inform our kin of what had happened,
But no sound came, no matter how long I waited.
As I wept, a shadow appeared beside me.
It was a young human, beautiful as a god,
Smiling, he took me,
And carried me away. I saw that
A large house was filled with divine treasures.
The young man lit a fire,
Placed a large pot over it, drew a sword,
And cut my body, skin and all, into pieces,
Filling the pot. Then he put my head under the pot,
And started the fire.
Desperate to escape, I looked for an opening,
But the young man never took his eyes off me.
'If the pot boils and I am cooked,
I will die a meaningless, terrible death!' I thought.
I watched for the young man's carelessness,
And finally transformed myself into a piece of meat,
Mingled with the rising steam, climbed to the pot's edge,
Leapt to the left side, and immediately
Fled outside, crying.
I ran, breathless, until I reached
My home, and sighed in relief that I was safe.
Looking back,
I realized that the human, the young man,
Was none other than Okikirmui, a god-like, powerful being.
Okikirmui was greatly angered by my daily mischief
Of destroying the crossbows set by humans, and tried to kill me with a small mugwort crossbow.
But, because I was not just any minor god, and a meaningless, terrible death
Would trouble and confuse my relatives,
He took pity on me
And did not chase after me when I escaped.
Since then, the hare,
Which was once as large as a deer,
Became as small as a piece of Okikirmui's flesh
because of my mischief.
From now on, our companions will all be this size.
From now on, hares, never be mischievous.
So, the hare chief taught his children before he died.

This is the English Translation 2.
Crossing two valleys, leaping over three,
I frolicked, following my brother into the mountains.
Day after day, behind him I'd see,
The crossbow traps of men, which he would shatter,
While I stood by, and laughed with glee.

One day, as usual, I went ahead,
Never imagining what lay in store instead.
My brother, caught within a snare,
Trapped by a crossbow, wailing in despair.

I rushed to him, aghast and shaken,
He cried, "Dear brother, now forsaken,
Hurry back to our village's rear,
And shout aloud—'My brother's trapped, oh hear! Ho-o! Ho-o-i!'"

I listened close, and quick replied, "I will!"
Then crossed two valleys, leaping three, until
I reached our village's hidden side.

Then I recalled the task he gave,
But all the words had fled my knave.
I stood there, blank, and tried to grasp,
But memory's hold had come unclasped.

So back again, I went once more,
Across two valleys, leaping three before,
Reversed my path, with hurried bound,
But found him gone, no trace around.
Only his blood, upon the ground.

(The story shifts, a different way)

Ketoka, woi woi, ketoka, ketoka, woi ketoka.

Each day I went into the hills,
Destroying human traps, fulfilling thrills.
One day I came upon a place,
Where crossbows stood, in grim embrace.
And by their side, a tiny thing,
A crossbow made of wormwood, offering.

I saw it there, and thought with scorn,
"What use is this, so small, forlorn?"
I touched it then, to run away,
But found myself held fast that day.

The more I struggled, more it bound,
In tears, I knew I was earth-bound.
Then something flew, and landed near,
My brother came, dispelling fear.
I bid him tell our kin my plight,
But silence stretched throughout the night.

I wept, until a form appeared,
A human youth, divinely revered.
He smiled, and seized me in his hand,
And led me to a wondrous land.
A giant house, with treasures bright,
Filled with objects of sacred light.

He lit a fire, placed a pot above,
Drew out a knife, with cruelest love,
And chopped my body, skin and bone,
To fill the pot, and claim his own.
My head he forced beneath the rest,
And stoked the flames, put to the test.

I sought a way to break the spell,
To find a flaw, where I might dwell.
But he was watchful, ever near,
"If I am boiled, consumed with fear,
My death is meaningless and vain!"

I sought his lapse, to break the chain,
And turned myself to vaporous meat,
Escaped the pot, with hurried feet,
Leapt to the seat upon the left,
And fled outside, of sense bereft.
I ran and wept, with gasping breath,
And reached my home, escaping death.

Too close, too close, I sighed with dread,
Then turned to see the path I'd tread.
The human youth, so plain and mild,
Was Okikirmui, a god beguiled.
I thought the traps were human-made,
But Okikirmui, was dismayed.
He sought to kill me with the small,
Wormwood crossbow, standing tall.
But I, too, am a god of might,
And if I died, in such a plight,
My kin would grieve, in deep despair,
So Okikirmui, showed me care.

He let me flee, he did not chase,
And since that day, the rabbit race,
Once large as deer, now small and meek,
Became a scrap, a god's mystique.
From now on, all our kin shall be,
As small as this, for all to see.

"From now on, rabbits, mischief cease!"
The rabbit chief taught, then found release.
