小狼の神が自ら歌った謡
「ホテナオ」

ホテナオ
ある日に退屈なので浜辺へ出て,
遊んでいたら一人の小男が
来ていたから,川下へ下ると
私も川下へ下り,
川上へ来ると私も川上へ行き道をさえぎった.
すると川下へ六回
川上へ六回になった時小男は
持前の癇癪かんしゃくを顔に表して言うことには,
「ピイピイ
この小僧め悪い小僧め,そんな事をするなら
この岬の,昔の名と今の名を
言い解いて見ろ」
私は聞いて笑いながらいうこと
には,
「誰がこの岬の昔の名と
今の名を知らないものか!
昔は,尊いえらい神様や人間が居ったから
この岬を神の岬と
言ったものだが,今は時代が衰えたから
御幣の岬とよんでいるのさ!」
云うと,小男の云うことには,
「ピイトン,ピイトン
この小僧め本当にお前はそういうなら
この川の前の名と今の名を
云って見ろ.」
聞くと,私の云うことには,
「誰がこの川の前の名
今の名を知らないものか!
昔,えらかった時代にはこの川を
流れの早い川と云っていたのだが
今は世が衰えているので流れの遅い川と
云っているのさ.」
云うと小男の云うことには,
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン
本当にお前そんな事を云うなら
お互の素性の解き合いをやろう.」
聞いて私の云うことには,
「誰がお前の素性を知らないものか!
大昔,オキキリムイが山へ行って
狩猟小舎を建てた時榛はしばみの木の炉縁ろぶちを作ったら
その炉縁が火に当ってからからに乾いてしまった.
オキキリムイが片方を踏むと片一方が
上る,それをオキキリムイが怒って
その炉縁を川へ持って下り
捨ててしまったのだ.
それからその炉縁は流れに沿うて流れていって
海へ出で,彼方かなたの海波,此方こなたの海波
に打ちつけられる様を神様たちが御覧になって,
敬うべきえらいオキキリムイの手作りの物がその様に
何の役にもたたず迷い流れて海水と共に腐ってしまうのは
勿体もったいない事だから神様たちから
その炉縁は魚にされて,
炉縁魚と
名づけられたのだ.
ところがその炉縁魚は,自分の素性が
わからないので,人にばけてうろついている.
その炉縁魚がお前なのさ.」
云うと,小男は顔色を
変え変え聞いていたが
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン!
お前は,小さい,狼の子なの
さ.」
云い終ると直ぐに海へパチャンと飛び込んだ.
あと見送ると一つの赤い魚が
尾鰭おびれを動かしてずーっと沖へ
行ってしまった.
と,幼い狼の神様が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Hotenao
One day, feeling bored, I went down to the beach,
As I was playing, a little man appeared.
When I went downstream,
He also went downstream.
When I went upstream, he also went upstream, blocking my path.
This happened six times downstream,
And six times upstream, until the little man,
His inherent temper flaring up, said with a scowl:
"Pii-pii!
You little brat, you wicked little brat! If you're going to act like that,
Tell me the old name and the current name
Of this cape, if you can!"
I listened and, laughing, replied:
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name
Of this cape!
In the old days, when there were noble and great gods and humans,
This cape was called the Cape of the Gods,
But now that the times have declined,
It is called the Cape of Gohei!"
Upon hearing this, the little man said:
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you really know so much,
Tell me the old name and the current name
Of this river."
Listening to him, I said:
"Who doesn't know the old name
And the current name of this river!
In the old days, in the era of greatness, this river
Was called the River of Swift Currents,
But now that the world is declining, it is called the River of Slow Currents."
Upon hearing this, the little man said:
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you really know so much,
Let us test each other's origins."
Listening to him, I said:
"Who doesn't know your origin!
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it became brittle and dry.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
Rose up, and Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
Then that hearth frame floated along the current
Out to the sea, and the gods, watching
It being tossed by the waves from afar and the waves from here,
Thought, 'It is a waste that something made by the hands
Of the revered and great Okikirmui should be
Wandering aimlessly and rotting away with the seawater, serving no purpose.' So the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And it was named the Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, not knowing its own origin,
Disguises itself as a person and wanders about.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you."
Upon hearing this, the little man's face
Changed color repeatedly,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You are a small, young wolf
God."
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
As I watched him go, a single red fish
Moved its tail fins and went far out to sea.
So, the young wolf god told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
One day, seized by utter boredom, I wandered to the seaside.
As I played there, a little dwarf appeared.
I went down the river,
He followed, going down the river too.
I went up the river, and he also went up, blocking my way.
Six times down the river,
Six times up the river, the little dwarf,
At last, unable to contain himself, said with a face full of anger:
"Piyi Piyi,
You little imp, you are a bad kid. If you dare to do this,
Tell me, what were the old and current names of this cape!"
Hearing this, I laughed and replied:
"Who wouldn't know the old and current names of this cape!
In the past, because noble and great gods and humans lived here,
This cape was called the Cape of Gods.
But now that times have declined,
It is called the Cape of Gohei!"
After hearing me, the little dwarf said:
"Piyiton, Piyiton,
You little imp, if you are so great,
Tell me, what were the old and current names of this river?"
Hearing this, I replied:
"Who wouldn't know the old and current names of this river!
In the past, in that great era, this river was called
The River of Rushing Water,
But now that the world has decayed, it is called the River of Slow Water."
After hearing me, the little dwarf said:
"Piyiton ton, Piyiton ton,
If you are so great,
Why don't we reveal each other's secrets?"
Hearing this, I replied:
"Who wouldn't know your secrets!
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
To build a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame from hazel wood.
The hearth frame was dried by the fire.
When Okikirmui stepped on one end of the hearth frame, the other end would
Lift up, and Okikirmui was annoyed by this,
So he took the hearth frame to the riverbank
And discarded it.
After that, the hearth frame drifted along the river,
Flowing into the sea. The gods saw it being battered by the distant waves and the nearby waves,
They thought it was a pity that something made by the beloved and great Okikirmui himself was
Drifting so uselessly, eventually rotting with the seawater, so the gods
Turned the hearth frame into a fish,
And named it Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, not knowing its origins,
Transformed into a human form and wandered around.
That Hearth Frame Fish is you."
After hearing me, the little dwarf's face
Changed several times,
"Piyiton ton, Piyiton ton!
You, are just a little, wolf cub."
As soon as he finished speaking, he plunged into the sea with a splash.
I watched him go, and saw a red fish
Waving its tail fins, swimming far away.
This is the story told by the young wolf god.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation is accurate and easy to understand. However, some of the phrasing is a bit literal and lacks the poetic quality that might be present in the original Ainu chant. The use of 'inherent temper flaring up' is a bit clunky.

#### Translation 2
This translation feels slightly more natural and captures the tone of a traditional story. The phrasing is generally smoother, and the word choices are more evocative. For example, 'seized by utter boredom' and 'unable to contain himself' are more vivid than the corresponding phrases in Translation 1.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the tone and rhythm of the original Japanese text slightly better, particularly in the dialogue. The word choices in Translation 2 also feel more evocative of a traditional Ainu narrative. While both translations are good, Translation 2 edges out Translation 1 in terms of overall flow and capturing the spirit of the original.
