沼貝が自ら歌った謡「トヌペカ ランラン」

トヌペカ ランラン
強烈な日光に私の居る所も
乾いてしまって今にも私は死にそうです.
「誰か,水を飲ませて下すって
助けて下さればいい.水よ水よ」と私たちが泣き叫んで
いますと,ずーっと浜の方から一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.
私たちは泣いていますと,私たちの傍を通り
私たちを見ると,
「おかしな沼貝,悪い沼貝,何を泣いて
うるさい事さわいでいるのだろう.」と言って
私たちを踏みつけ,足先にかけ飛ばし,貝殻と共につぶして
ずーっと山へ行ってしまいました.
「おお痛,苦しい,水よ水よ.」と泣き叫んで
いると,ずっと浜の方からまた一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.私たちは
「誰か私たちに水を飲ませて助けて下さるといい,
おお痛,おお苦しい,水よ水よ.」と叫び泣きました
すると,娘さんは,神の様な美しい気高い様子で
私の側へ来て私たちを見ると,
「まあかわいそうに,大へん暑くて沼貝たちの
寝床も乾いてしまって水を欲しがって
いるのだね,どうしたのでしょう
何だか踏みつけられでもした様だが......」と言いつつ
私たちみんなを拾い集めて蕗の葉に
入れて,きれいな湖に入れてくれました.
清い冷水でスッカリ元気を恢復し
大へん丈夫になりました.そこで始めて
かの女たちの気性を探って
見ると,先に来て,私を踏みつぶした
にくらしい女,わるい女はサマユンクルの
妹で,私たちを憫み
助けて下さった若い娘さん淑しとやかな方
は,オキキリムイの妹なのでありました.
サマユンクルの妹は悪にくらしいので
その粟畑を枯らしてしまい,オキキリムイの
妹のその粟畑をばよく実らせました.
その年に,オキキリムイの妹は大そう多く収穫をしました.
私の故為せいでそうなった事を知って
沼貝の殻で粟の穂を摘みました.
それから,毎年,人間の女たちは
栗の穂を摘む時は沼貝の殻を使う様になったのです.
と,一つの沼貝が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Tonupeka Ranran,
The intense sunlight has dried up my dwelling,
And now I feel as though I am about to die.
"If only someone would give us water to drink,
If only someone would help us! Water, water!" we cried.
Then, from the direction of the shore,
A woman came carrying a basket on her back.
As we cried, she passed by us,
And seeing us, she said,
"Strange clams, wretched clams, why are you crying
And making such a noisy fuss?"
She trampled us, kicked us with her toes,
Crushing us with our shells,
And went far away into the mountains.
"Oh, it hurts, it's painful, water, water!" we cried.
Then, from the direction of the shore,
Another woman came carrying a basket on her back.
We cried,
"If only someone would give us water to drink and help us!
Oh, it hurts, oh, it's painful, water, water!" we cried.
Then, the maiden, with a divine and beautiful air,
Came to my side, and seeing us, she said,
"Oh, how pitiful! It's so hot, and the clams'
Bedding has dried up, and they are longing for water.
What could have happened?
It looks as though they have been trampled..."
Saying this, she gathered us all up,
Placed us in butterbur leaves,
And put us in a clear lake.
With the pure, cold water, we completely regained our strength,
And became very healthy. Then, for the first time,
I investigated the nature of these women.
The hateful woman who came first and crushed me,
The wicked woman, was the sister of Samayunkuru.
The young maiden who pitied us
And helped us, the gentle and graceful one,
Was the sister of Okikirmui.
The sister of Samayunkuru, being evil and hateful,
Caused her millet field to wither,
And the sister of Okikirmui
Caused her millet field to bear much fruit.
That year, the sister of Okikirmui harvested a great abundance.
Knowing that this was due to my doing,
She harvested the millet ears with clam shells.
From then on, every year, human women
Came to use clam shells when harvesting millet ears.
So, a clam narrated.

This is the English Translation 2.
Tonpekka ranran,
The fierce sun scorched the place I called home,
Dried and cracked, I was near death.
"Who will have mercy, grant us sweet rain,
Save our lives, water, water!" we cried and wailed.
Suddenly, in the distance, a woman approached from the shore,
Carrying a bamboo basket, hurrying along.
We cried out incessantly, but she walked right past us,
Seeing our plight, she mocked us coldly:
"Detestable swamp clams, ugly swamp clams, why do you cry and clamor,
Disturbing the peace!"
Having said that, she trampled us underfoot, kicking us far away,
Crushing us along with our shells, she left, heading deep into the mountains.
"Pain, suffering, water, water!" we wailed.
Again, in the distance, a woman approached from the shore,
Also carrying a bamboo basket.
We cried out: "If only someone would grant us sweet rain, save our lives,
Pain, suffering, water, water!"
That woman, as beautiful and noble as a goddess,
Came to our side, saw our plight, and pitied us:
"How pitiful, the heat is unbearable, the swamp clams'
home is dried up, longing for sweet rain,
What has happened here?
It seems they have been trampled…"
Saying this, she picked us up one by one,
Placed us in butterbur leaves, and then placed us in the clear lake water.
The cool lake water restored our vitality,
Made us strong.
And so, we began to investigate
the nature of those two women.
The detestable woman who trampled us,
was the sister of Samayunkur; while the young woman who pitied us,
saved us, gentle and quiet,
was the sister of Okikirmui.
The sister of Samayunkur harbored malice,
causing her millet fields to wither; while the sister of Okikirmui
caused her millet fields to flourish.
That year, the sister of Okikirmui had a bountiful harvest.
She knew it was because of us,
So she used the shells of the swamp clams to harvest the millet ears.
From then on, every year, the women of humankind
would use the shells of swamp clams when harvesting millet ears.
This, is the story told by a swamp clam.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Pros: Accurate and straightforward. Cons: Lacks some of the poetic nuance of the original; some phrases are a bit clunky.

#### Translation 2
Pros: More vivid language and slightly more poetic. Cons: "Bamboo basket" is not necessarily implied in the original text, and "grant us sweet rain" is an interpretation rather than a direct translation.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is better because it uses more vivid language and maintains a slightly more poetic tone, which is appropriate for a chant. For example, phrases like "grant us sweet rain" and "detestable swamp clams" are more evocative than the plainer language in Translation 1. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 2 captures the emotional and narrative elements of the original Japanese text more effectively.
