The Fox's Own Song: "Towatowato"

Towatowato,
One day, I went to the shore to gather food.
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
As I went, I looked ahead and saw
A whale had washed ashore.
The people were all dressed in finery,
Rejoicing in the bounty of the sea, dancing in celebration,
Some cutting the meat, others carrying it away.
The important ones offered thanks and prayers to the sea.
Some sharpened their knives; the beach was black with people.
Seeing this, I was overjoyed.
"Ah, I must hurry and get there,
I want to receive even a little bit!" I thought,
And shouting, "Banzai! Banzai!"
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I went closer and closer, but then,
Unexpectedly,
What I thought was a beached whale
Was just a pile of dog feces on the shore,
A great mountain of dung.
That is what I had mistaken for a whale.
And what I thought were people dancing and rejoicing in the sea's bounty,
Cutting and carrying the meat,
Were just crows pecking at the dung,
Scattering it this way and that,
Flying here and there.
I was furious.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
One whose rear oozes resin!
One whose rear drips foul water!
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
Running from the seaside,
I saw in the distance
A boat, and in the boat,
Two people were exchanging condolences.
"Oh, what sudden event
Could cause them to do such a thing? Perhaps
Someone has capsized with their boat.
Ah, I must go closer and
Listen to what they are saying!"
So, shouting "Hoo-hoo-hoi!"
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew as if on wings to see,
But what I thought was a boat
Was just a rock on the shore,
And what I thought were people
Were just two large cormorants.
Two large cormorants stretching and retracting
Their long necks, which I mistook
For people exchanging condolences.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
One whose rear oozes resin!
One whose rear drips foul water!
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew up the river,
And far upstream,
Two women stood in the shallows, weeping together.
I was startled to see this.
"Oh, what misfortune has befallen them?
What ill tidings have arrived that they weep so?
Ah, I must hurry and
Listen to what they are saying!"
So,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew as if on wings to see,
But in the middle of the river were two yana (fish weirs),
And the posts of the two yana
Were swaying in the current,
Which I mistook for two women
Looking down and then up,
Weeping together.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
One whose rear oozes resin!
One whose rear drips foul water!
What a way to see things!"
Then again, I went up the river,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew as if on wings back home.
Looking ahead,
I saw that, somehow,
My house was ablaze,
The smoke rising into the sky
Like gathering clouds. Seeing this, I
Was so startled I nearly fainted.
I leaped up, shouting in a woman's voice,
And from the other side, someone
Came flying towards me, shouting "Hoi!" in a loud voice.
It was my wife, her face pale with shock, breathless.
"Husband, what is it?" she asked.
I looked, and what had seemed like a fire,
My house stood as before.
No fire, no smoke.
It was just that my wife was hulling grain (tsukimono),
And at that moment, a strong wind blew,
Scattering the winnowed rice bran (nuka)
Which I had mistaken for smoke.
I had gone out in search of food but found none, and on top of that,
Because I had shouted so loudly, my wife
Was so startled that she threw the winnowing basket
And the rice bran into the air.
So tonight, we will have nothing to eat.
I was furious and threw myself
Onto the floor and went to sleep.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
One whose rear oozes resin!
One whose rear drips foul water!
What a way to see things!"
So spoke the head of the fox.

狐之歌：「托瓦托瓦托」

托瓦托瓦托，
某日，我往海濱覓食。
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
行進間，我遙望遠方，
竟見一鯨擱淺於岸。
人們盛裝打扮，
歡慶海洋的恩賜，起舞歡騰，
有人切割鯨肉，有人搬運而去。
德高望重者，向大海獻上感恩與祈禱。
有人磨礪刀刃；海灘上人頭攢動。
見此情景，我欣喜若狂。
「啊，我必得趕緊前往，
哪怕只分得一小塊！」我心想，
於是高呼：「萬歲！萬歲！」
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
我越靠越近，然而，
出乎意料地，
我所認為的擱淺鯨魚，
不過是岸邊一堆狗糞，
一座巨大的糞山。
那正是我誤以為是鯨魚之物。
而我所認為的人們，正為海洋的恩賜而歌舞，
切割並搬運鯨肉，
不過是烏鴉啄食糞便，
將其四處散落，
飛來飛去。
我怒火中燒。
「盲目的，毫無價值的蠢貨！
盲目的，邪惡的蠢貨！
尾巴底下臭烘烘的傢伙！
尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙！
屁股後面滲樹脂的傢伙！
屁股後面滴髒水的傢伙！
真是糟糕的眼力啊！」

再次地，
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
我從海邊奔離，
遙望遠方，
一葉扁舟，舟中
兩人互致哀悼之意。
「啊，究竟是何等突發事件，
竟使他們如此悲傷？或許
有人翻船落水。
啊，我必得靠近，
傾聽他們在說些什麼！」
於是，高呼「呼—呼—嘿！」
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
我如飛鳥般疾馳而去，
然而我所認為的船隻，
不過是岸邊一塊岩石，
而我所認為的人們，
不過是兩隻巨大的鸕鶿。
兩隻巨大的鸕鶿伸長又縮回
它們的長脖子，我誤以為
是人們互致哀悼之意。
「盲目的，毫無價值的蠢貨！
盲目的，邪惡的蠢貨！
尾巴底下臭烘烘的傢伙！
尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙！
屁股後面滲樹脂的傢伙！
屁股後面滴髒水的傢伙！
真是糟糕的眼力啊！」

再次地，
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
我沿河飛翔而上，
在遙遠的上游，
兩名女子佇立淺灘，一同哭泣。
我見此情景，大吃一驚。
「啊，究竟是何等不幸降臨於她們？
是何等噩耗傳來，使她們如此悲傷？
啊，我必得趕緊前往，
傾聽她們在說些什麼！」
於是，
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
我如飛鳥般疾馳而去，
然而在河流中央，是兩座 yana (魚梁),
兩座 yana 的木樁，
在水流中搖曳，
我誤以為那是兩名女子，
低頭又抬頭，
一同哭泣。
「盲目的，毫無價值的蠢貨！
盲目的，邪惡的蠢貨！
尾巴底下臭烘烘的傢伙！
尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙！
屁股後面滲樹脂的傢伙！
屁股後面滴髒水的傢伙！
真是糟糕的眼力啊！」

再次地，我沿河而上，
石礫間，喳啦喳啦，
浮木中，喳啦喳啦。
我如飛鳥般飛回家中。
遙望前方，
我看到，不知為何，
我的房子燃起了熊熊大火，
濃煙升騰至天空，
宛如聚集的雲朵。見此情景，我
驚慌失措，幾乎昏厥。
我跳了起來，用女人的聲音尖叫，
從另一邊，有人
朝我飛奔而來，大聲喊著「嘿！」
那是我的妻子，她面色蒼白，驚魂未定，氣喘吁吁。
「丈夫，怎麼了？」她問道。
我定睛一看，原本看似燃燒的火焰，
我的房子依舊如故。
沒有火，沒有煙。
只不過是我的妻子正在舂米 (tsukimono)，
而就在那時，一陣強風吹過，
吹散了揚起的米糠 (nuka)，
我誤以為那是煙霧。
我外出尋找食物，卻一無所獲，更糟糕的是，
因為我叫得如此大聲，我的妻子
嚇得把簸箕
和米糠都扔到了空中。
所以今晚，我們將無食可果腹。
我怒不可遏，一頭栽倒
在地板上，呼呼大睡。
「盲目的，毫無價值的蠢貨！
盲目的，邪惡的蠢貨！
尾巴底下臭烘烘的傢伙！
尾巴底下腐爛的傢伙！
屁股後面滲樹脂的傢伙！
屁股後面滴髒水的傢伙！
真是糟糕的眼力啊！」

狐之首領如是說。
