## Preface

Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was the realm of freedom for our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. Truly, they were nature's darlings, such blessed people they were.

In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the forests, braving the freezing air that chilled the earth, crossing mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they sailed their leaf-like boats on the green waves where cool breezes swam, the songs of white gulls their companions, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending their days singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the crimson autumn, they parted the fields of pampas grass, whose ears swayed in the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon faded into the evening. With the calls of deer echoing through the valleys, they dreamt beneath the round moon. Ah, what a joyous life!

That peaceful world is now a thing of the past. Decades have passed since those dreams were shattered. This land has undergone rapid transformation, with mountains and fields gradually giving way to villages, and villages to towns.

Before we knew it, the ancient face of nature has faded, and where have all the people who once lived joyfully in the fields and mountains gone? The few of our kin who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Yet, the beautiful souls of those ancient people, whose every action was governed by religious sentiment, are now gone from their eyes, replaced by anxiety and resentment, dulled and clouded, unable to see the way forward. They must rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now. What a sorrowful name we bear.

In the past, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state.

Time flows ceaselessly, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of the defeated in this fierce arena of competition, perhaps someday two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our ardent hope, and we pray for it morning and night.

But... will all the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other daily, the ancient and beautiful words they passed down, all disappear along with the perishing weak? Oh, that is too heartbreaking and regrettable.

Born an Ainu and raised within the Ainu language, I have written down in clumsy prose one or two of the very small stories from the many tales our ancestors used to gather and enjoy on rainy evenings and snowy nights whenever I had some free time.

If many who know us can read this, I, along with our ancestors, will truly feel boundless joy and supreme happiness.

## 序

很久以前，這片廣闊的北海道土地是我們祖先自由的國度。他們像天真的孩子一樣，被美麗的大自然擁抱，悠閒快樂地生活著。 真的，他們是大自然的寵兒，是如此幸福的人們。

在冬天，他們踢開覆蓋森林的厚厚積雪，冒著冰冷的空氣，穿越一座又一座山去獵熊。 在夏天，他們在綠色的波浪上航行著葉子般的小船，涼爽的微風在其中游動，白鷗的歌聲是他們的伴侶，整天釣魚。 在百花盛開的春天，他們沐浴在柔和的陽光下，與永遠鳴叫的鳥兒一起歌唱，採集蜂斗菜和艾蒿。 在深紅色的秋天，他們分開芒草田，芒草的穗在秋風中搖曳，直到捕鮭魚的篝火在傍晚消失。 鹿的叫聲在山谷中迴盪，他們在圓月下做夢。 啊，多麼快樂的生活啊！

那個和平的世界現在已經成為過去。 自那些夢想破滅以來，已經過去了幾十年。 這片土地經歷了快速的轉變，山脈和原野逐漸讓位於村莊，村莊讓位於城鎮。

在我們還沒意識到的時候，大自然古老的面貌已經褪色，曾經在田野和山脈中快樂生活的人們都到哪裡去了？ 我們為數不多的族人只能驚訝地看著這個變化中的世界。 然而，那些古代人美麗的靈魂，他們的一舉一動都受到宗教情感的支配，現在已經從他們的眼中消失了，取而代之的是焦慮和怨恨，變得遲鈍和陰暗，無法看到前進的方向。 他們必須依靠別人的憐憫，真是可悲的景象。 哦，那些正在消亡的人……那就是我們現在的名字。 我們背負著多麼悲傷的名字啊。

過去，我們幸福的祖先永遠無法想像他們的家園有一天會淪落到如此悲慘的境地。

時間不停地流逝，世界無限地前進。 在我們這些正在這激烈的競爭舞台上暴露失敗者醜態的人中，也許有一天會出現兩三個堅強的個體，最終有一天我們可以跟上這個前進的世界。 這確實是我們熱切的希望，我們日夜為此祈禱。

但是……我們敬愛的祖先過去每天用來互相交流的那麼多語言，他們傳承下來的古老而美麗的文字，會不會隨著消亡的弱者一起消失呢？ 哦，那太令人心碎和遺憾了。

我生為Ainu人，在Ainu語中長大，每當我有空閒時間，我就用笨拙的文字寫下我們祖先過去常在下雨的傍晚和下雪的夜晚聚集在一起欣賞的許多故事中的一兩個非常小的故事。

如果許多了解我們的人都能讀到這篇文章，我和我們的祖先都會感到無比的喜悅和至高的幸福。
