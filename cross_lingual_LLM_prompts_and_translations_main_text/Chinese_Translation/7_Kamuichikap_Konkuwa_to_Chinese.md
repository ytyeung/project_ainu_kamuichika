The Owl God's Own Song: "Konkwa"

"Konkwa,
In the old days, when I spoke, it was like the sound of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark,
Resonating from the center of the *kyuha* (bow grip),
But now, alas, I am weakened and old.
Yet, if there were someone eloquent,
Confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven."

So I spoke, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* (lacquered box) with *tagatsuki* (metal fittings),
When someone at the entrance said,
"Who but I is so eloquent and confident as a messenger?"
And when I looked, it was a young crow.
I let him into the house, and then, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
To appoint the young crow as my messenger,
I explained the negotiation for three days,
But as I spoke of the third point, I saw
The young crow dozing behind the hearth.
Seeing this, I was enraged,
And I struck the young crow with all my feathers and killed him.

Then again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
"If there is anyone confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven."
Then someone again at the entrance said,
"Who but I is so eloquent
As to stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
And when I looked, it was a jay from the mountains.

I let him into the house, and then again,
Tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
I spoke of the negotiation of five and a half *yo*,
And after four days, as I spoke of the fourth point,
The mountain jay was dozing behind the hearth.
I was furious and struck the mountain jay with all my feathers
And killed him.

Then again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven."
Then someone entered with
A respectful demeanor, and when I looked,
It was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance,
Who sat on the left side. And so I,
Tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
Continued to speak of the five and a half points,
Night and day. And when I looked,
The young river crow showed no sign of fatigue,
Listening, and counting the days and nights,
On the sixth day, as soon as I finished speaking,
He went straight out through the skylight
And departed for Heaven.

The gist of the negotiation was this: in the human world,
There was a famine, and the humans were on the verge
Of starvation. When I investigated the reason,
I found that the gods in Heaven
Who controlled the deer and the fish
Had consulted and decided to withhold both deer and fish.
No matter what was said to them, they turned a deaf ear,
So when the humans went to the mountains to hunt,
There were no deer, and when they went to the rivers
To fish, there were no fish.
I was angered by this, so
I appointed a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

After many days had passed,
A faint sound could be heard in the sky,
And someone entered. When I looked,
It was the young river crow, now even more beautiful
And possessing a valiant dignity,
Who began to deliver the counter-negotiation.

The reason the deer god and the fish god in Heaven
Had withheld the deer and the fish until today
Was that when the humans caught deer,
They struck the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,
They left the deer's head as it was in the mountain *kihara* (field),
And when they caught fish,
They killed them by striking their heads with rotten wood.
So the deer, naked and weeping,
Returned to the deer god, and the fish
Returned to the fish god, carrying the rotten wood in their mouths.
The deer god and the fish god were
Angry and consulted, and withheld the deer
And the fish. But if from now on
The humans treat both deer and fish
With care, then they will release the deer
And release the fish, so the deer god and
The fish god said, he reported in detail.

After hearing this, I offered praise to the young river crow,
And saw that indeed
The humans had treated the deer and fish
Carelessly. From then on,
I taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,
Never to do such things again, and the humans
Realized their wrongdoings, and from then on,
They made beautiful fishing tools like *nusa* (sacred wands),
And used them to catch fish. When they caught deer, they also
Decorated the deer's head beautifully and offered it in sacrifice.
So the fish rejoiced and carried the beautiful *gohei* (paper streamers)
To the fish god, and the deer
Rejoiced and returned to the deer god,
With newly shaved *sakayaki* (hair on the head).
The deer god and
The fish god were pleased and
Released many fish and many deer.
The humans now live without any hardship
Or hunger,
And I was relieved to see this.

I am now old, weakened, and frail,
And I was thinking of going to Heaven,
But because there was a famine in the human land that I protect,
And the humans were on the verge of starvation, I could not
Go without concern, so
I have remained until now, but now that there is
Nothing to worry about, I will place the strongest,
A young hero, in my place to protect the human world,
And now I am going to Heaven."

So spoke the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the land,
And departed for Heaven. So it is told.

貓頭鷹神之歌：「Konkwa」

「Konkwa，
往昔，我之言語，如櫻皮纏繞弓弦之聲，
迴盪於*kyuha*（弓握）之中，
然如今，唉，我已衰老虛弱。
然若有雄辯之人，
如使者般自信，
我願託付其與天交涉五又二分之一*yo*。」

如是說著，我以*tagatsuki*（金屬配件）輕敲*shintoko*（漆盒）之蓋，
忽聞入口處有人言，
「捨我其誰，能如我般雄辯，自信如使者？」
我望去，乃一幼鴉。
我允其入室，而後，再以*tagatsuki*輕敲*shintoko*之蓋，
欲任命幼鴉為我之使者，
我詳述交涉之事，歷時三日，
然當我述及第三點時，我見
幼鴉於爐灶之後打盹。
見此情景，我怒火中燒，
遂以我之羽毛擊打幼鴉，並將其殺之。

而後再次，以*tagatsuki*輕敲*shintoko*之蓋，
「若有自信如使者之人，
我願託付其與天交涉五又二分之一*yo*。」
忽聞入口處又有人言，
「捨我其誰，能如我般雄辯，
可為通天之使者？」
我望去，乃一來自山間之松鴉。

我允其入室，而後再次，
以*tagatsuki*輕敲*shintoko*之蓋，
我詳述交涉五又二分之一*yo*之事，
歷時四日，當我述及第四點時，
山間松鴉竟於爐灶之後打盹。
我怒不可遏，遂以我之羽毛擊打山間松鴉，
並將其殺之。

而後再次，以*tagatsuki*輕敲*shintoko*之蓋，
「若有雄辯且自信如使者之人，
我願託付其與天交涉五又二分之一*yo*。」
忽有人以
恭敬之姿入內，我望去，
乃一外貌俊美之小河烏，
坐於左側。 故我，
以*tagatsuki*輕敲*shintoko*之蓋，
持續講述五又二分之一點之事，
日以繼夜。 而我觀之，
小河烏毫無倦色，
傾聽，並計算著日夜，
至第六日，我甫一講完，
其便徑直穿過天窗
啟程前往天界。

交涉之要旨如下：於人世間，
有饑荒，人類瀕臨
餓死之境。 我探究其因，
方知天界諸神，
掌管鹿與魚者，
經商議後，決意扣留鹿與魚。
無論對其說何，皆置若罔聞，
故人類入山狩獵，
無鹿可尋，入河
捕魚，亦無魚可獲。
我對此甚為惱怒，故
我任命使者前往鹿神與魚神處。

多日過去，
天空中隱約可聞聲響，
有人入內。 我望去，
乃小河烏，如今更為俊美，
且具威武之儀，
開始傳達反交涉之內容。

天界鹿神與魚神
扣留鹿與魚至今之原因，
乃因人類捕獲鹿時，
以木擊鹿首，剝皮時，
任鹿首留於山間*kihara*（田野），
捕獲魚時，
則以朽木擊其首而殺之。
故鹿，赤身裸體，哭泣著，
回到鹿神處，魚
則口銜朽木，回到魚神處。
鹿神與魚神
甚為憤怒，經商議後，扣留了鹿
與魚。 然若自此以後，
人類能善待鹿與魚，
則將釋放鹿，
釋放魚，鹿神與
魚神如是說，其詳盡稟報。

聽聞此言，我對小河烏讚賞有加，
並察覺到，的確
人類對待鹿與魚
有所疏忽。 自此以後，
我於人類之睡夢中教導，
切莫再犯，人類
亦意識到自身之過錯，自此以後，
製作精美之漁具，如*nusa*（神聖的魔杖），
並以此捕魚。 捕獲鹿時，亦
精美裝飾鹿首，並獻為祭品。
故魚歡欣鼓舞，攜帶精美之*gohei*（紙 streamers）
前往魚神處，鹿
亦歡欣鼓舞，回到鹿神處，
頭頂新剃之*sakayaki*（頭上的頭髮）。
鹿神與
魚神甚為欣悅，
遂釋放眾多魚與眾多鹿。
人類如今生活無憂，
亦無饑餓之苦，
見此情景，我甚感欣慰。

我如今已老，虛弱，且衰老，
本欲前往天界，
然因我所守護之人間有饑荒，
人類瀕臨餓死之境，我無法
毫無顧慮地離去，故
我留守至今，然如今已
無須擔憂，我將委任最強壯之，
年輕英雄，代替我守護人世，
而今，我將前往天界。」

如是說著，老神（貓頭鷹），土地之守護神，
啟程前往天界。 故事如是說。
