The Song of the Little Wolf God, Sung by Himself
"Hotenao"

Hotenao,
One day, feeling bored, I went to the beach,
As I was playing, a little man appeared.
When I went downstream, he followed me downstream,
When I went upstream, he also went upstream, blocking my path.
This happened six times downstream,
And six times upstream. The little man,
His inherent temper flaring on his face, said,
"Pii pii!
You little brat, you bad little brat! If you do such things,
Tell me the old name and the current name
Of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, replied,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name
Of this cape!
In the old days, because there were revered and great gods and people,
This cape was called the Cape of the Gods,
But now that the times have declined,
It is called the Cape of Nusa (御幣の岬)!"
Upon hearing this, the little man said,
"Piiton, piiton!
You little brat, if you really know,
Tell me the old name and the current name
Of this river!"
Listening, I said,
"Who doesn't know the old name
And the current name of this river!
In the old, great times, this river
Was called the River with the Swift Current,
But now that the world is declining, it is called the River with the Slow Current."
Upon hearing this, the little man said,
"Piitonton, piitonton!
If you really say such things,
Let us reveal each other's true nature."
Listening, I said,
"Who doesn't know your true nature!
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting hut, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
Rose up. Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
From there, that hearth frame flowed along the current,
Went out to sea, and the gods watched
As it was struck by the waves from afar and the waves from here.
They thought, 'It is a waste that something handmade by the revered and great Okikirmui
Is pointlessly drifting and decaying with the seawater,
So the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And it was named Robuchi fish (炉縁魚).'
However, that Robuchi fish doesn't know its own origin,
So it disguises itself as a person and wanders around.
That Robuchi fish is you!"
As I said this, the little man's face
Changed color as he listened,
"Piitonton, piitonton!
You are a small, wolf cub."
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
Looking after him, a single red fish
Moved its tail fin and went far offshore.
So, the young wolf god told his story.

小狼神自述之歌
「Hotenao」

Hotenao 啊，
有一日，我感到百般無聊，便來到了海邊。
嬉戲之時，出現了一個小矮人。
我順流而下，他也跟著順流而下；
我逆流而上，他也逆流而上，擋住了我的去路。
順流而下六次，皆是如此，
逆流而上六次，亦是如此。那小矮人，
面露怒色，顯露出他天生的壞脾氣，說道：
「Pii pii！
你這小毛孩，你這壞小子！若你再這樣做，
就告訴我這海岬的古老名字和現在的名字！」
我聽了，笑著回答：
「誰人不知這海岬的古老名字和現在的名字！
在古老的歲月裡，因為有受人尊敬的偉大神祇和人民，
這海岬被稱為神之岬，
但如今時代衰落，
它被稱為 Nusa (御幣の岬)！」
聽聞此言，小矮人說道：
「Piiton, piiton！
你這小毛孩，如果你真的知道，
就告訴我這條河流的古老名字和現在的名字！」
我聽了，說道：
「誰人不知這條河流的古老名字
和現在的名字！
在古老而偉大的時代，這條河流
被稱為湍急之河，
但如今世界衰落，它被稱為緩慢之河。」
聽聞此言，小矮人說道：
「Piitonton, piitonton！
如果你真的敢這麼說，
就讓我們揭露彼此的真面目。」
我聽了，說道：
「誰人不知你的真面目！
很久以前，當 Okikirmui 去山裡
建造狩獵小屋時，他用榛木做了一個爐框。
當那個爐框暴露在火中時，它完全乾透了。
當 Okikirmui 踩在一邊時，另一邊
翹了起來。 Okikirmui 對此感到憤怒，
便把爐框拿到河邊
扔掉了。
從那裡，那個爐框順著水流漂流，
流向大海，眾神看著
它被遠處和近處的波浪拍打。
他們想，『受人尊敬的偉大 Okikirmui 手工製作的東西
毫無意義地隨著海水漂流和腐爛，真是浪費，
所以眾神
把那個爐框變成了一條魚，
它被命名為 Robuchi 魚 (炉縁魚)。』
然而，那條 Robuchi 魚不知道自己的起源，
所以它偽裝成一個人四處遊蕩。
那條 Robuchi 魚就是你！」
當我說這些話時，小矮人的臉
聽著，臉色都變了，
「Piitonton, piitonton！
你是一隻小狼崽。」
話音剛落，他就濺入海中。
看著他離去的方向，一條紅色的魚
擺動著尾鰭，游向遠海。
於是，年輕的狼神講述了他的故事。
```
