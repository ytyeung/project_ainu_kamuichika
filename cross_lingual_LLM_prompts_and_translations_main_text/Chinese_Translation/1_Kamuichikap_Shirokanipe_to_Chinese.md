The Owl God's Own Song:
"Silver drops fall, fall around me."

Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I descended along the river, passing over a human village. Looking down, I saw the once poor now rich, and the once rich now poor.

Children played on the beach with toy bows and arrows. As I passed over them, singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," they ran beneath me, crying out:

"A beautiful bird! A god's bird! Come, shoot it down! Whoever hits the god's bird first is the true hero, the true strong one!"

The children of the newly rich, with golden bows and golden arrows, aimed at me. I dodged their golden arrows, flying above and below. Among them, one child stood apart, with a simple wooden bow and arrow. I could see he was poor, even in his clothes. Yet, in his eyes, I saw the lineage of greatness, a unique spirit among them. He, too, aimed his simple bow and arrow at me.

The children of the newly rich laughed, saying, "How foolish, poor child! The bird, the god's bird, won't even take notice of our golden arrows. Why would it ever care for your rotten wooden arrow?"

They kicked and shoved the poor child, but he paid them no mind, focusing on me. Seeing this, I felt a deep pity.

Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I slowly circled in the sky. The poor child stood with one foot forward and one back, biting his lip in concentration, and released his arrow. The small arrow flew beautifully towards me, and I reached out and caught it.

Spinning, I danced on the wind and descended. The children raced, kicking up dust in their wake. As I landed on the ground, the poor child reached me first and took me in his hands.

The children of the newly rich ran up, showering him with insults, pushing and hitting him. "Hateful child, poor child! You dared to take what we wanted first!" The poor child shielded me with his body, holding me tightly to his chest.

Struggling, he finally broke free and ran, the children of the newly rich throwing stones and wood after him. He didn't falter, running through the dust to a small hut. He slipped me through the first window, telling the story of what had happened.

From inside, an old couple came, shading their eyes. Though they were poor, they carried themselves with the grace of a gentleman and lady. Seeing me, they bowed deeply in surprise. The old man straightened his belt and prayed to me.

"Owl God, Great God, thank you for visiting our humble home. We were once counted among the wealthy, but now we are poor. It is an honor to host you, but as night has fallen, we offer you shelter for tonight. Tomorrow, we will send you off with only inaw, though it is not enough."

He repeated his prayers many times. The old woman laid a mat beneath the east window and placed me there. Soon, they were all asleep, snoring loudly.

I sat between my ears, on my head, and awoke near midnight. Singing softly, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I flew from the left side of the house to the right, making beautiful sounds.

As I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, god's treasures, fell around me with a melodious sound. In an instant, I filled the small house with magnificent treasures, god's treasures.

Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I transformed the small house into a house of gold, a grand mansion. I created a storehouse of magnificent treasures and adorned the house with beautiful, newly made clothes.

I decorated the grand mansion even more splendidly than the homes of the wealthy. When I was finished, I returned to my place between my ears, on my head.

I showed the family a dream, revealing that I had seen the Ainu nishpa, unlucky and poor, being mocked and bullied by the newly rich. I pitied him, and though I am not a god of high status, I stayed in their human home and bestowed blessings upon them.

As dawn approached, the family awoke together. Rubbing their eyes, they looked around the house and were stunned. The old woman cried out, and the old man shed large tears. Finally, the old man rose and came to me, offering many prayers. He said,

"We thought it was just a dream, but it is real! It is already an honor for you to visit our humble home, Great God. You have pitied our misfortune and bestowed upon us the greatest of blessings!" He spoke through his tears.

Then, the old man cut inaw wood and crafted beautiful inaw to adorn me. The old woman prepared herself and had the young child help her gather firewood and water, preparing to brew sake. In an instant, six sake barrels were lined up in the place of honor.

I spoke with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various other gods.

After two days, the scent of sake filled the house, a favorite of the gods. The child, dressed in old clothes, was sent to invite the newly rich from the village. As they watched him go, the child entered each house and delivered the message.

The newly rich laughed, saying, "How strange! What kind of sake and feast could the poor have to offer? Let's go see what's happening and have a laugh!"

They came in a large group, but some were so shocked and ashamed by the sight of the house that they turned back. Others came to the front of the house and were too stunned to move.

The woman of the house came out and took each of their hands, inviting them inside. They crawled in, unable to lift their faces.

The master of the house rose and spoke with a voice as beautiful as a cuckoo bird. He told them the story, saying, "We were poor and unable to associate with each other, but the Great God has pitied us. We had no ill intentions, and so we have received these blessings. From now on, we are all family in this village, and I hope we can all be friends and visit each other."

The people repeatedly clasped their hands together and apologized to the master of the house, promising to be friends from now on. They also prayed to me.

With softened hearts, they began a grand feast. I watched the humans dance and sing, conversing with the fire god, the house god, and the god of the altar, and I was deeply pleased. After two or three days, the feast ended.

Seeing the humans living in harmony, I felt at peace. I bid farewell to the fire god, the house god, and the god of the altar. Then, I returned to my home.

Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful gohei and fine sake. I sent messengers to the near and far gods, inviting them to a grand feast. At the feast, I told the gods about my visit to the human village and the events that had transpired. The gods praised me greatly.

As the gods departed, I gave them two or three beautiful gohei each.

Looking towards the Ainu village, I saw that it was now peaceful, and the humans were all friends. The nishpa was now the head of the village.

His child had grown into an adult, with a wife and children, and was devoted to his parents. Whenever they brewed sake, they would send gohei and sake to me at the beginning of the feast.

I sit behind the humans, always protecting the human land.

So, the Owl God told his story.

貓頭鷹神之歌：
「銀色的露珠落下，落在我身旁。」

我唱著歌，「銀色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，金色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，」沿著河流降落，經過一個人類的村莊。我向下看去，看見曾經貧窮的人變得富有，曾經富有的人變得貧窮。

孩子們在海灘上玩著玩具弓箭。當我經過他們頭頂，唱著，「銀色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，金色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，」他們在我身下奔跑，呼喊著：

「一隻美麗的鳥！是神明的鳥！快，射下來！誰先射中神明的鳥，誰就是真正的英雄，真正的強者！」

新富人家的孩子們，用金色的弓和金色的箭，瞄準我。我躲避著他們的金色箭矢，忽上忽下地飛翔。在他們之中，有一個孩子與眾不同，他拿著簡單的木弓和木箭。我看得出他很貧窮，甚至從他的衣著就能看出來。然而，在他的眼中，我看到了偉大的血統，一種與眾不同的精神。他也用他那簡陋的弓箭瞄準我。

新富人家的孩子們嘲笑著說：「多麼愚蠢啊，窮孩子！這隻鳥，這隻神明的鳥，甚至不會注意到我們的金色箭矢。牠怎麼會在意你那根腐朽的木箭呢？」

他們踢打、推搡那個窮孩子，但他毫不在意，專注地看著我。看到這一幕，我感到深深的憐憫。

唱著，「銀色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，金色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，」我在天空中緩慢地盤旋。那個窮孩子一腳在前，一腳在後，咬著嘴唇，全神貫注，然後鬆開了他的箭。那支小小的箭優美地飛向我，我伸出手，抓住了它。

旋轉著，我在風中起舞，然後降落。孩子們競相奔跑，揚起陣陣塵土。當我落在地上時，那個窮孩子第一個跑到我身邊，將我捧在手中。

新富人家的孩子們跑了過來，用侮辱的言語淹沒他，推打著他。「可惡的孩子，窮孩子！你竟然敢搶先拿走我們想要的東西！」那個窮孩子用身體保護著我，緊緊地將我抱在胸前。

掙扎著，他終於掙脫了束縛，跑了起來，新富人家的孩子們在他身後扔石頭和木頭。他沒有退縮，穿過塵土，跑到一間小茅屋前。他將我從第一個窗戶塞了進去，講述了剛才發生的事情。

從屋裡走出一對老夫婦，用手遮擋著眼睛。雖然他們很貧窮，但他們舉止優雅，像一對紳士和淑女。看到我，他們驚訝地深深鞠躬。老爺爺整理了一下腰帶，向我祈禱。

「貓頭鷹神，偉大的神，感謝您光臨我們簡陋的家。我們曾經也算是富有，但現在我們很貧窮。很榮幸能接待您，但夜幕已經降臨，我們只能為您提供今晚的庇護。明天，我們將用inaw送您離開，雖然這還遠遠不夠。」

他重複祈禱了很多遍。老奶奶在東窗下鋪了一張草蓆，把我放在那裡。很快，他們都睡著了，發出響亮的鼾聲。

我坐在我的耳朵之間，在我的頭頂上，在午夜時分醒來。輕輕地唱著，「銀色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，金色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，」我從房子的左側飛到右側，發出美妙的聲音。

當我拍打翅膀時，美麗的寶藏，神明的寶藏，伴隨著悅耳的聲音落在我身旁。一瞬間，我用華麗的寶藏，神明的寶藏，填滿了這間小小的房子。

唱著，「銀色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，金色的露珠落下，落在我身旁，」我將這間小房子變成了一座金色的房子，一座宏偉的豪宅。我創造了一個儲藏著華麗寶藏的倉庫，並用美麗的、新做的衣服裝飾了房子。

我將這座宏偉的豪宅裝飾得比富人的家還要華麗。完成後，我回到了我原來的位置，在我的耳朵之間，在我的頭頂上。

我向這家人展示了一個夢，揭示了我看到Ainu nishpa，不幸而貧窮，被新富人嘲笑和欺負。我憐憫他，雖然我不是地位很高的神，但我還是留在了他們人類的家中，並賜予他們祝福。

黎明臨近時，這家人一起醒來。揉著眼睛，他們環顧四周，驚呆了。老奶奶驚叫起來，老爺爺流下了大滴眼淚。最後，老爺爺站起身，走到我面前，獻上許多祈禱。他說：

「我們以為這只是一個夢，但這是真的！偉大的神，您光臨我們簡陋的家，已經是我們的榮幸了。您憐憫我們的不幸，並賜予我們最大的祝福！」他哽咽著說。

然後，老爺爺砍下inaw木，製作出美麗的inaw來裝飾我。老奶奶準備好自己，讓年輕的孩子幫她收集柴火和水，準備釀造清酒。一瞬間，六個清酒桶排列在尊貴的位置上。

我與火之老婦，古老的女​​神，以及其他各種神靈交談。

兩天后，清酒的香味瀰漫在屋子裡，這是神靈們最喜歡的味道。孩子穿著舊衣服，被派去邀請村裡的新富人。當他們看著他離開時，孩子走進每家每戶，傳達了這個消息。

新富人們嘲笑著說：「多麼奇怪！窮人能提供什麼樣的清酒和盛宴呢？我們去看看發生了什麼事，嘲笑一番吧！」

他們一大群人走了過來，但有些人看到這座房子的景象，感到震驚和羞愧，便轉身回去了。另一些人來到房子前面，驚呆了，動彈不得。

房子的女主人走出來，握住他們每個人的手，邀請他們進去。他們爬了進去，抬不起頭。

房子的主人站起身來，用像杜鵑鳥一樣美妙的聲音說話。他告訴他們這個故事，說：「我們很窮，無法互相交往，但偉大的神憐憫了我們。我們沒有惡意，所以我們得到了這些祝福。從今以後，我們都是這個村莊的家人，我希望我們都能成為朋友，互相拜訪。」

人們反覆合攏雙手，向房子的主人道歉，承諾從今以後成為朋友。他們也向我祈禱。

他們的心軟化了，開始了一場盛大的宴會。我觀看著人類跳舞和唱歌，與火神、家神和祭壇之神交談，我感到非常高興。兩三天后，宴會結束了。

看到人類和諧地生活在一起，我感到很安心。我向火神、家神和祭壇之神告別。然後，我回到了我的家。

在我到達之前，我的房子裡擺滿了美麗的御幣和上好的清酒。我派使者到遠近的神靈那裡，邀請他們參加盛大的宴會。在宴會上，我告訴神靈們我訪問人類村莊的經歷以及發生的事情。神靈們對我讚不絕口。

當神靈們離開時，我給了他們每人兩三個美麗的御幣。

望向Ainu村莊，我看到現在很和平，人類都是朋友。 nishpa現在是村莊的負責人。

他的孩子已經長大成人，有了妻子和孩子，並且孝順父母。每當他們釀造清酒時，他們都會在宴會開始時將御幣和清酒送到我這裡。

我坐在人類的身後，永遠保護著人類的土地。

就這樣，貓頭鷹神講述了他的故事。
