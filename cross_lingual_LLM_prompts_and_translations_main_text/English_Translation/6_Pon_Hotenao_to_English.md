小狼之神親自吟唱的歌謠
「ホテナオ」

ホテナオ
某日，我百般無聊，便來到海邊，
正當我玩耍之際，一個小矮人
走了過來，我往河下游走去，
他也跟著往河下游走，
我往河上游去，他也往河上游走，擋住了我的去路。
如此在河下游來回六次，
河上游來回六次後，小矮人
面露他那與生俱來的急躁，說道：
「匹伊匹伊
你這小鬼，壞小鬼，你要是再這樣，
就說說看這海岬，過去和現在的名字！」
我聽了，笑著回答說：
「誰會不知道這海岬過去和
現在的名字呢！
從前，因為有尊貴偉大的神明和人類居住於此，
所以這海岬被稱為神之岬，
但如今時代衰退，
便被稱作御幣之岬！」
聽我說完，小矮人說道：
「匹伊頓，匹伊頓
你這小鬼，你若真這麼厲害，
就說說看這條河，過去和現在的名字。」
我聽了，回答說：
「誰會不知道這條河過去和
現在的名字呢！
從前，在那個偉大的時代，這條河被稱為
水流湍急之河，
但如今世道衰敗，便被稱作水流緩慢之河。」
聽我說完，小矮人說道：
「匹伊頓頓，匹伊頓頓
你若真這麼厲害，
不如我們來互相揭露彼此的底細。」
我聽了，回答說：
「誰會不知道你的底細呢！
很久以前，オキキリムイ去山裡
建造狩獵小屋時，用榛木做了爐緣，
那爐緣被火烤得乾燥。
オキキリムイ一踩爐緣的一端，另一端
就會翹起來，オキキリムイ對此感到惱火，
便把那爐緣拿到河邊
丟棄了。
之後，那爐緣便順著河流漂流，
流向大海，神明們看見它被遠方的海浪，近方的海浪
拍打的樣子，
心想，值得尊敬的偉大オキキリムイ親手製作的東西，竟然如此
毫無用處地迷失漂流，與海水一同腐爛，
實在太可惜了，於是神明們便
將那爐緣變成了魚，
並命名為爐緣魚。
然而，那爐緣魚，因為不知道自己的身世，
便化為人形四處遊蕩。
你就是那爐緣魚。」
聽我說完，小矮人面色
數變，
「匹伊頓頓，匹伊頓頓！
你，是隻小小的，狼之子啊。」
話一說完，立刻撲通一聲跳入海中。
我目送著他，只見一條紅色的魚
擺動著尾鰭，一直往遠方游去。
這就是，年幼的狼神所講述的故事。

The Song Sung by the Wolf Cub God Himself
"Hotenao"

Hotenao.
One day, seized by utter boredom, I wandered to the seaside.
As I played, a little dwarf approached.
When I went down the river, he followed.
When I went up the river, he blocked my path.
Six times we went back and forth down the river,
Six times up the river, until the little dwarf,
His innate impatience showing, declared:
"Pii pii!
You little brat, you wicked imp! If you continue like this,
tell me the past and present names of this cape!"
I listened, and laughing, replied:
"Who doesn't know the past and present names of this cape!
Long ago, because noble and great gods and humans dwelled here,
this cape was called the Cape of Gods.
But now, in these degenerate times,
it is known as the Cape of Gohei!"
Hearing this, the little dwarf said:
"Pii ton, pii ton!
You little brat, if you're so clever,
tell me the past and present names of this river."
I listened, and replied:
"Who doesn't know the past and present names of this river!
Long ago, in that great era, this river was called
The River of Rushing Waters.
But now, in these declining times, it is known as the River of Slow Waters."
Hearing this, the little dwarf said:
"Pii ton ton, pii ton ton!
If you're so clever,
let us reveal each other's true nature."
I listened, and replied:
"Who doesn't know your true nature!
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
to build a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
The frame was dried by the fire.
When Okikirmui stepped on one end, the other
would rise up. Annoyed by this,
Okikirmui took the frame to the riverbank
and discarded it.
Afterward, the frame floated down the river,
toward the sea. The gods saw it being tossed by the distant waves, the nearby waves,
and thought,
'It is a pity that something made by the esteemed and great Okikirmui
is so uselessly lost, rotting with the seawater.' So the gods
transformed the frame into a fish,
and named it Hearth Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth Frame Fish, unaware of its origins,
transformed into human form and wandered about.
You are that Hearth Frame Fish."
Hearing this, the little dwarf's face
changed many times,
"Pii ton ton, pii ton ton!
You are a small, wolf cub."
As soon as he said this, he plunged into the sea with a splash.
I watched him go, and saw a red fish
swimming far away, wagging its tail fin.
This is the story told by the young Wolf God.
