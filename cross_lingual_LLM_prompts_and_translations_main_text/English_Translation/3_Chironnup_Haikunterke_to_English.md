狐狸親自吟唱的歌謠
「ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ」

ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ
在國之岬，神之岬之上，
我曾端坐於此。
某日，我走出戶外，
只見海面風平浪靜，遼闊無垠，海面上，
オキキリムイ、シュプンラムカ和サマユンクル
三人乘船出海狩獵，見此情景，
我內心邪念頓生。
在這岬角，國之岬，神之岬，
之上，我輕盈地，腰肢柔軟地奔走。
以沉重的語調，如折斷木片般，啪嗚，啪嗚地叫喊，
怒視著這條河流的源頭，召喚暴風的魔力。
隨之而來，從這條河的
源頭湧出強烈的風，龍捲風，
一進入海面，立刻
海面翻騰，上下顛倒。オキキリムイ他們
的漁船在近海之人和遠海之人的
交匯之處（海的中央），遭遇突變，在波浪間
旋轉。巨大的浪濤如山一般
覆蓋船隻。於是，
オキキリムイ、サマユンクル、シュプンラムカ
奮力呼喊，划動船槳。
這艘小船如落葉般被吹飛，
眼看就要傾覆，
令人欽佩的是，人們充滿力量，
這艘小船在風中，
在波浪上滑行。
看到這些，我內心的邪念再次湧現。
我輕盈地，腰肢柔軟地奔走，
以沉重的語調，如折斷木片般，啪嗚，啪嗚地叫喊，
竭盡全力聲援暴風的魔力。
在這樣做的過程中，終於，サマユンクル
的手上，手下，鮮血直流，
疲憊地倒下了。
看到這情景，我暗自竊笑。
然後，我又竭盡全力，
輕盈地，腰肢柔軟地奔走，
以沉重的語調，如折斷木片般叫喊，
聲援暴風的魔力。
オキキリムイ和シュプンラムカ兩人
互相鼓勵，勇敢地划著船，
突然，某個時候，シュプンラムカ的
手上，手下，鮮血直流，
疲憊地倒下了，看到這些，
我暗自竊笑。
然後，我又輕盈地，腰肢柔軟地
跳躍奔走，以沉重的語調，如折斷堅硬的木片
般叫喊，竭盡全力。
但是，オキキリムイ卻沒有絲毫疲憊的樣子。
他身上披著一件薄衣，
划著船，不久，
他手中的船槳，斷裂了。
於是，他撲向疲憊而死的サマユンクル，
奪走他手中的船槳，獨自一人
划著船。
看到這些，我內心的邪念再次湧現。
以沉重的語調，如折斷堅硬的木片般叫喊，
輕盈地，腰肢柔軟地奔走，
竭盡全力聲援暴風的魔力。
在這樣做的過程中，サマユンクル的舵也
斷裂了。オキキリムイ撲向シュプンラムカ，
奪走他的船槳，
勇敢地划著船。
但是，他的船槳也被海浪折斷了。
於是，オキキリムイ在船中
站立著，在狂風中，
他萬萬沒想到身為人類的他會發現我，
他凝視著國之岬，神之岬
之上的，我的眼睛。
他原本溫柔的臉上顯露出憤怒之色，
擺弄著他的袋子，
從中取出的是，蓬草的小弓和
蓬草的小箭。
看到這些，我暗自竊笑。
「人類又能做什麼，有什麼可怕的，
那種蓬草的小箭有什麼用呢。」
我這樣想著，在這岬角，
國之岬，神之岬之上，
我一直向上，一直向下，輕盈地
腰肢柔軟地奔走，以沉重的語調，
如折斷堅硬的木片般，啪嗚，啪嗚地叫喊，
讚美暴風的魔力。
在其中，オキキリムイ射出的箭飛來，
正好刺中我的衣領。
從那以後，我就不知道發生了什麼。
突然回過神來，
天氣非常好，海面上
遼闊無垠，オキキリムイ的漁船什麼的都沒有了。
怎麼回事，我的頭頂
到腳底，都像雁皮燃燒收縮般疼痛。
萬萬沒想到人類射出的小箭會如此折磨我，於是我掙扎著，
在這岬角，國之岬，神之岬
之上，一直向上，一直向下，哭喊著
掙扎，白天黑夜，時而活著，
時而死去，在這樣做的過程中，我不知道
發生了什麼。
突然回過神來，
我身處於大黑狐的兩隻耳朵之間。
大約過了兩天，オキキリムイ以神靈般的姿態
前來，笑眯眯地說道，
「真是好看啊，守護國之岬，神之岬
之上的黑狐神，
因為擁有善良的心，神的心，
所以死得如此體面。」
說著，他取下我的頭，
帶回自己的家，將我的上顎骨
作為自己廁所的地基，將我的下顎
作為他妻子的廁所的基石，
我的身體就那樣與泥土一同腐爛了。
從那以後，無論白天黑夜，
我都飽受惡臭的折磨，我死得毫無價值，死得很慘。
我並非只是身份低微的神靈，
但因為我懷有極其邪惡的心，所以一無是處，
我死得很慘，
所以，從今以後的狐狸們啊，千萬
不要懷有邪惡的心。

狐狸神這樣講述著。

The Song of the Fox, Sung by Himself
"Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori"

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemutori
Upon the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I sat in my place.
One day, I stepped outside,
And saw the sea, serene and vast. Upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunkamuka, and Samayunkuru
Sailed out to hunt. Seeing this,
A wicked thought arose within me.
On this cape, the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran lightly, with a supple waist.
In a heavy voice, like splintering wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
I glared at the river's source, summoning the magic of the storm.
And then it came, from the river's
source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
That rushed upon the sea, and at once
the sea churned, upside down. Okikirmui and his companions'
Fishing boat, at the meeting place of those from the near shore and the far (the sea's center),
Met with sudden change, spinning in the waves.
Great waves, like mountains,
Covered the boat. And so,
Okikirmui, Samayunkuru, Shupunkamuka
Cried out in desperation, rowing with all their might.
The small boat was tossed like a fallen leaf,
On the verge of capsizing.
Yet, admirable were these men, full of strength,
As the small boat sailed on the wind,
Upon the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked thought arose in me again.
I ran lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like splintering wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
Striving with all my power to aid the storm's magic.
And as I did, at last, Samayunkuru's
hands, his arms, ran with blood,
And he collapsed in exhaustion.
Seeing this, I chuckled to myself.
Then, I strained with all my might,
Running lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like splintering wood, I cried,
To aid the storm's magic.
Okikirmui and Shupunkamuka encouraged each other,
Rowing bravely on, when suddenly,
Shupunkamuka's
hands, his arms, ran with blood,
And he collapsed in exhaustion. Seeing this,
I chuckled to myself.
Then, I leaped and ran lightly, with a supple waist,
In a heavy voice, like the cracking of hard wood,
Straining with all my power.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of weariness.
He wore only a thin garment,
And rowed on, until,
The oar in his hands, it broke.
And so, he lunged at the exhausted and fallen Samayunkuru,
Seized the oar from his hands, and alone,
He rowed on.
Seeing this, the wicked thought arose in me again.
In a heavy voice, like the cracking of hard wood, I cried,
Running lightly, with a supple waist,
Striving with all my power to aid the storm's magic.
And as I did, Samayunkuru's rudder,
It broke. Okikirmui lunged at Shupunkamuka,
Seized his oar,
And rowed on bravely.
But his oar, too, was broken by the waves.
And so, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, in the raging wind,
Never imagining that a human like him would see me,
He gazed at the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
And into my eyes.
His gentle face turned to anger,
And he rummaged in his bag,
And from it, he took a small bow of mugwort,
And a small arrow of mugwort.
Seeing this, I chuckled to myself.
"What can a human do? What is there to fear?
What use is such a small arrow of mugwort?"
I thought, and on this cape,
The Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran up and down, lightly,
With a supple waist, in a heavy voice,
Like the cracking of hard wood, I cried, "Pah-woo, pah-woo!"
Praising the storm's magic.
And then, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
And struck me right in the collar.
From then on, I knew nothing more.
When I came to my senses,
The weather was fair, and the sea
Was vast and serene. Okikirmui's fishing boat was gone.
What had happened? From the top of my head
To the tips of my toes, I ached as if scorched.
Never had I imagined that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so. And so I struggled,
On this cape, the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
I ran up and down, crying out,
Struggling, day and night, sometimes living,
Sometimes dying. And as I did, I knew not
What had happened.
When I came to my senses,
I was between the ears of a great black fox.
About two days later, Okikirmui came as a divine spirit,
Smiling, and said,
"How beautiful! The black fox god, guarding the Cape of the Land, the Cape of the Gods,
Because he possessed a kind heart, a divine heart,
He died so honorably."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it back to his home, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the cornerstone of his wife's toilet.
My body, as it was, rotted with the earth.
From then on, day and night,
I suffered the torment of foul odors. I died without worth, I died miserably.
I was not merely a low-ranking god,
But because I harbored an extremely wicked heart, I was worthless.
I died miserably.
And so, from now on, you foxes, never,
Never harbor a wicked heart.

Thus spoke the fox god.
