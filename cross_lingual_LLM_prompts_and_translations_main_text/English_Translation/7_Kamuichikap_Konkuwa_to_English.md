貓頭鷹神親自吟唱的歌謠

「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
往昔我發言之時，如鳴響纏繞櫻花樹皮的弓，
弓把之央迴盪不已，
如今卻已衰老，年歲漸長。
然而，若有雄辯滔滔，
對使者之職充滿自信之人，
我願派遣其前往天國，進行五又二分之一的談判。」

我一邊敲擊著鑲邊的シントコ蓋子，一邊說道。此時，入口處傳來聲音：
「捨我其誰，能擔此雄辯之使者重任，充滿自信？」

我定睛一看，原來是隻年輕的烏鴉。
我將其迎入屋內，然後，一邊敲擊著鑲邊的シントコ蓋子，
為了派遣這年輕的烏鴉為使者，
我向其詳細講述談判內容，三日過去，
當我講述第三項談判要點時，卻發現
這年輕的烏鴉在爐邊打起了瞌睡。見此情景，我怒火中燒，
一把抓住年輕烏鴉的翅膀，將其活活打死。

隨後，我又敲擊著鑲邊的シントコ蓋子，
「若有對使者之職充滿自信之人，
我願派遣其前往天國，進行五又二分之一的談判。」

話音剛落，又有人在入口處說道：
「捨我其誰，能如此雄辯，
足以擔當前往天國的使者？」

我循聲望去，原來是隻山喜鵲。
我將其迎入屋內，然後再次
敲擊著鑲邊的シントコ蓋子，
向其講述五又二分之一的談判內容，
四日過去，當我講述第四項要點時，
這山喜鵲竟在爐邊打起了瞌睡。
我怒不可遏，一把抓住山喜鵲的翅膀，將其活活打死。

之後，我又敲擊著鑲邊的シントコ蓋子，
「若有雄辯滔滔，對使者之職
充滿自信之人，我願派遣其前往天國，
攜帶五又二分之一的談判內容。」

此時，有人以恭敬的姿態走了進來，我仔細一看，
原來是隻年輕的河烏，姿態優美，
端坐在左側。於是我
敲擊著鑲邊的シントコ蓋子，
不分晝夜地向其講述五又二分之一的要事。

只見這年輕的河烏，毫無疲憊之色，
靜靜地聆聽著，日夜兼程，
數到第六日，
我剛一講完，它便立刻從天窗
飛出，前往天國。

這場談判的大致內容是，人類世界
正遭受饑荒，人們瀕臨
餓死。究其原因，
原來是天國
掌管鹿的神明和掌管魚的神明
商議決定，不再降下鹿和魚，
無論人們如何懇求，他們都置之不理，
因此，人們前往山中
狩獵，卻一無所獲，前往河中
捕魚，也空手而歸。

我見此情景，怒火中燒，
遂派遣使者前往鹿神和魚神處。

數日過去，
空中傳來微弱的聲響，
有人走了進來。我定睛一看，
原來是那年輕的河烏，如今比之前更加俊美，
渾身散發著英勇的氣概，
開始陳述回覆的談判內容。

天國的鹿神和魚神
之所以至今不降下鹿和魚，
是因為人類在捕獲鹿時，
用木頭敲擊鹿的頭部，剝下鹿皮後，
便將鹿頭隨意丟棄在山林之中；
捕獲魚時，
用腐爛的木頭敲擊魚的頭部致其死亡，
因此，鹿群赤身裸體，哭泣著
回到鹿神的身邊，魚群
口銜腐爛的木頭，回到魚神的
身邊。鹿神和魚神
怒不可遏，商議決定，不再降下鹿和魚。

但如果今後
人類能夠善待鹿和魚，
那麼他們便會再次降下鹿和魚，
鹿神和魚神如此說道，並詳細陳述了緣由。

聽聞此言，我向年輕的河烏
表達了讚賞之情，並發現
人類確實
對待鹿和魚過於粗暴。

從那以後，為了讓人們不再重蹈覆轍，
我在他們入睡時，於夢中
告誡他們，人類也意識到
自己的過錯，從此以後，
他們像對待幣帛ぬさ一般，精美地製作捕魚工具，
用其捕魚。捕獲鹿時，也會將鹿頭
精心裝飾並祭祀，因此，
魚兒們歡欣鼓舞地銜著美麗的御幣ごへい
前往魚神的身邊，鹿兒們
也高興地梳理著新月代さかやき，回到鹿神的
身邊。鹿神和
魚神見此情景，喜出望外，
降下大量的魚，降下大量的鹿。

人類如今已不再有任何困擾，
也不再遭受饑餓之苦，
我見此情景，感到十分安心。

我已年老體衰，
本想前往天國，
但想到我所守護的人類國度
正遭受饑荒，人們瀕臨餓死，
我無法置之不理，
因此一直留在此處，但如今已
再無任何牽掛，我將選出最為強大、
年輕的勇者來繼承我的職位，守護人類世界，
而我，今日便將前往天國。」

國家的守護神，貓頭鷹翁神，
講述完畢，便前往天國了。故事到此結束。

The Song of the Owl God Himself: 

"Konkwa"

"Konkwa,
In days of old, when I spoke, my voice resonated like a bowstring wrapped with cherry bark,
echoing from the center of the bow's handle.
But now, I have grown old, my years advancing.
Yet, if there be one eloquent and confident
to undertake the task of a messenger,
I shall dispatch them to the heavens to negotiate five and two-fifths of a matter."

As I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid, I spoke these words. Just then, a voice arose from the entrance:
"Who but I is so eloquent and confident as to bear the weight of this messenger's task?"

I looked and saw it was a young crow.
I welcomed it inside, and as I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
I began to explain the details of the negotiation to this young crow,
Three days passed,
and as I spoke of the third point of negotiation, I noticed
the young crow had fallen asleep by the hearth. Enraged, I seized
the young crow by its wings and beat it to death.

Then, I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid once more:
"If there be one confident in the task of a messenger,
I shall dispatch them to the heavens to negotiate five and two-fifths of a matter."

No sooner had I spoken than another voice called from the entrance:
"Who but I is so eloquent,
so capable of being a messenger to the heavens?"

I looked and saw it was a magpie.
I welcomed it inside, and again
Tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
explaining the five and two-fifths of the negotiation.
Four days passed, and as I spoke of the fourth point,
the magpie fell asleep by the hearth.
I was overcome with rage, seized the magpie by its wings, and beat it to death.

Afterward, I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid again:
"If there be one eloquent and confident
in the task of a messenger, I shall dispatch them to the heavens,
bearing five and two-fifths of a negotiation."

At that moment, one entered with a respectful demeanor. I looked closely and saw
it was a young dipper, graceful in form,
seated to my left. And so,
I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
explaining the five and two-fifths of the matter, day and night.

The young dipper, showing no sign of weariness,
listened quietly, tirelessly,
and on the sixth day,
as soon as I finished speaking, it flew
from the skylight, heading for the heavens.

The essence of this negotiation was that the human world
was suffering from famine, its people on the verge
of starvation. The reason for this,
was that the gods of the heavens,
the god of deer and the god of fish,
had decided not to send down deer and fish,
ignoring all pleas from the people.
Thus, the people went to the mountains
to hunt, but found nothing, and went to the rivers
to fish, but returned empty-handed.

Seeing this, I was filled with rage,
and so I dispatched a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

Days passed,
and a faint sound echoed from the sky,
and one entered. I looked closely and saw
it was the young dipper, now more beautiful than before,
radiating an aura of courage,
and it began to recount the negotiated response.

The deer god and the fish god of the heavens
had ceased sending down deer and fish
because humans, when catching deer,
would strike their heads with wood, and after skinning them,
would carelessly discard the deer heads in the mountains.
And when catching fish,
would strike their heads with rotten wood until they died.
Thus, the herds of deer, naked and weeping,
returned to the deer god, and the schools of fish,
mouths filled with rotten wood, returned to the fish god.
The deer god and the fish god,
overcome with rage, decided to no longer send down deer and fish.

But if, from now on,
humans treat the deer and fish with kindness,
then they would once again send down deer and fish,
so said the deer god and the fish god, explaining the reason in detail.

Hearing this, I expressed my admiration to the young dipper,
and realized that
humans had indeed
treated the deer and fish too harshly.

From that day on, to prevent people from repeating their mistakes,
I warned them in their dreams as they slept.
The humans realized
their errors, and from then on,
they crafted fishing tools as exquisitely as they would *nusa* offerings,
using them to catch fish. When catching deer, they would also
carefully adorn and offer the deer heads in ritual. Thus,
the fish joyfully carried beautiful *gohei* offerings
to the fish god, and the deer
happily groomed their *sakayaki* hairlines, returning to the deer god.
The deer god and the
fish god, seeing this, were overjoyed,
sending down abundant fish, sending down abundant deer.

The humans now faced no more hardship,
nor did they suffer from hunger,
and seeing this, I felt at peace.

I have grown old and frail,
and had intended to go to the heavens,
but thinking of the human realm I protect,
suffering from famine, its people on the verge of starvation,
I could not ignore them,
and so I remained here. But now,
I have no more attachments. I shall choose the strongest,
youngest warrior to inherit my position, protecting the human world,
and I, today, shall depart for the heavens."

The guardian deity of the land, the old Owl God,
having finished speaking, departed for the heavens. And so, the story ends.
