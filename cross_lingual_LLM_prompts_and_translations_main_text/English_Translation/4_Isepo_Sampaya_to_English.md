兔子親自吟唱的歌謠「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
躍過兩道山谷，跳過三道山谷
嬉戲玩耍，跟隨著兄長的腳步前往山裡。
每日每日，跟在兄長身後，我總看見
人類設下的弩弓陷阱，兄長便將那弩弓
破壞殆盡，而我總是嘲笑此事。
這天，我如常前往，卻
萬萬沒想到
兄長竟被弩弓所困，痛苦哀嚎。
我大吃一驚，飛奔到兄長身旁
兄長哭泣著說道：
「弟弟啊，你現在趕緊
跑回我們的村莊後方
大聲呼喊——兄長被弩弓困住了，呼喔呼——！」
我聽了，
連聲應道：「好！好！」然後
躍過兩道山谷，跳過三道山谷
嬉戲玩耍地來到
我們村莊的後方。
這時，我才想起兄長派我前來的目的。
我正要放聲呼喊
卻完全忘記了兄長要我傳達的話語。
我呆立在那裡，試圖回想
卻怎麼也想不起來。
然後，我又
越過兩道山谷，跳過三道山谷
倒退著，跳躍著
回到兄長所在的地方
卻發現空無一人。
只剩下兄長的血跡四處散落。
(故事至此轉向另一個方向)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
每日每日，我前往山裡
破壞人類設下的弩弓陷阱
並以此為樂。
某天，我又來到之前的地方，發現
那裡設下了弩弓，而在旁邊
還設了一個小小的艾草弩弓。
我看到後，心想
「這種東西，有什麼用呢？」
覺得十分可笑，便
稍微碰了一下，正想立刻逃開
卻萬萬沒想到
竟被那弩弓緊緊地
牢牢困住。
越是掙扎
束縛就越緊，我束手無策
只能哭泣。
這時，有什麼東西
飛到我身旁，我一看，原來是我的弟弟。
我欣喜若狂，囑咐他將此事
告知我們族人，
但等了許久，卻毫無音訊。
我哭泣著，這時
出現了一個身影。我仔細一看
是位如同神祇般俊美的人類青年。
他笑咪咪地抓住我
帶到某個地方。我發現
那是一間巨大的房屋，裡面堆滿了神聖的寶物。
那位青年點燃了火
將一口大鍋架在火上，拔出懸掛著的刀
將我的身體連皮帶骨地剁成碎塊
裝滿了整口鍋，然後將鍋子放在我的頭上
開始點火燒煮。我一心想著
逃離這裡，便伺機尋找人類青年的破綻
但他卻寸步不離地盯著我。
「如果鍋子煮沸，我被煮爛了，那將會是
毫無意義，死得難看的死法。」
我這樣想著，便伺機尋找人類青年的疏忽
好不容易，我將自己化為一片肉片
混入升騰的蒸汽中，爬到鍋子的邊緣
跳到左邊的座位上，然後立刻
衝到戶外，哭泣著
氣喘吁吁地逃回
我的家裡，
總算鬆了一口氣，慶幸自己逃過一劫。
回頭一看，
我原本以為只是一個人類，一個普通的青年
沒想到竟是オキキリムイ，如同神祇般強大的存在。
我原本以為只是人類設下的弩弓
每天每天惡作劇地破壞它，オキキリムイ
非常生氣，想用艾草小弩
殺死我，但我也並非
只是地位低下的神祇，如果死得毫無意義，死得難看
我的親族們也會感到困擾。
他憐憫我的處境
因此，即使我逃走了，他也沒有追趕。
從那以後，原本
兔子有像鹿一樣大的身軀
但因為我做了這樣的惡作劇
便變得像オキキリムイ的一片肉片一樣小。
從今以後，我們的同伴大概都會變成這麼小的
身軀吧。
從今以後的兔子們啊，千萬不要再惡作劇了。
兔子首領這樣教導著孩子們，然後去世了。

The Song of the Rabbit, Sung by Himself: "Sanpaya Tereke"

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys I leaped, over three I hopped,
Playing and frolicking, following my elder brother into the mountains.
Day after day, behind my brother, I saw
The crossbow traps set by humans. My brother would
Destroy them all, and I would laugh at this.
One day, as usual, I went along, but
Never did I imagine
My brother would be caught in a crossbow, wailing in pain.
Startled, I rushed to his side.
My brother cried out:
"Little brother, quickly now,
Run back behind our village
And shout loudly – Brother is trapped by a crossbow, hoo-ooh-hoo!"
I listened,
Responding, "Yes! Yes!" and then
Across two valleys I leaped, over three I hopped,
Playing and frolicking, arriving
Behind our village.
It was then I remembered why my brother had sent me.
I was about to shout,
But I completely forgot the words he wanted me to convey.
I stood there, trying to recall,
But I couldn't remember at all.
Then, I
Leaped across two valleys, hopped over three,
Backwards, jumping,
Returning to where my brother was,
But he was nowhere to be found.
Only his blood scattered all around.

(The story shifts in a new direction)

Ketoka woiwoi ketoka, ketoka woi ketoka,
Day after day, I went into the mountains,
Destroying the crossbow traps set by humans,
Taking pleasure in it.
One day, I came to the usual place and found
A crossbow set there, and beside it
A small *yomogi* (艾草) crossbow.
Seeing it, I thought,
"What use is something like this?"
Finding it laughable, I
Touched it slightly, intending to run away immediately,
But never did I imagine
I would be tightly,
Firmly trapped by that crossbow.
The more I struggled,
The tighter the bonds became, and I was helpless,
Only able to weep.
Then, something
Flew to my side. I looked and saw it was my younger brother.
Overjoyed, I told him to
Inform our people of this,
But after waiting a long time, there was no news.
I wept, and then
A figure appeared. I looked closely and saw
A human youth, as beautiful as a god.
Smiling, he seized me
And took me to a certain place. I discovered
It was a huge house, filled with sacred treasures.
That youth lit a fire,
Placed a large pot over the flames, drew a hanging knife,
Chopped my body, skin and bones, into small pieces,
Filled the entire pot, then placed the pot on my head
And began to cook me. I thought only of
Escaping from here, and looked for an opening in the human youth's watchfulness,
But he watched me closely.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked to pieces, it will be
A meaningless, ugly death."
Thinking this, I looked for a moment of carelessness from the human youth,
And finally, I transformed myself into a slice of meat,
Mixed into the rising steam, climbed to the edge of the pot,
Jumped onto the seat to the left, and then immediately
Dashed outside, weeping,
Panting, I fled back
To my home,
Finally relieved, grateful to have escaped.
Looking back,
I realized that what I thought was just a human, an ordinary youth,
Was actually *Okikirmui*, a being as powerful as a god.
What I thought were just human crossbows,
Which I mischievously destroyed every day, angered *Okikirmui*.
He wanted to kill me with a small *yomogi* crossbow, but I am not
Just a low-ranking god. If I were to die meaninglessly, die ugly,
My kin would be troubled.
He pitied my situation,
So even though I escaped, he did not pursue me.
From then on, originally
The rabbit had a body as large as a deer,
But because I played such a prank,
I became as small as a slice of meat from *Okikirmui*.
From now on, our companions will probably all become this small
In body.
From now on, rabbits, never play pranks again.
The rabbit leader taught his children this, and then passed away.
