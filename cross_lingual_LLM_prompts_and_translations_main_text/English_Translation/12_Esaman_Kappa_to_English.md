水獺自歌之謠
「卡帕 留留 卡帕」

卡帕 留留 卡帕
某日，我沿著溪流嬉戲而下，
來到薩瑪雲庫魯（Samayunkuru）的汲水路。
薩瑪雲庫魯的妹妹，如神祇般美麗，
一手提著水桶，一手拿著香蒲。
我只露出頭在河邊，問道：
「妳有父親嗎？妳有母親嗎？」

那少女驚訝地睜大眼睛，四處張望，
發現了我，臉上頓時充滿怒色，
「啊，可憎的扁頭，惡劣的扁頭，
竟敢愚弄人！狗兒們，上啊……」

話音未落，幾隻巨犬便衝了出來，
對著我齜牙咧嘴。我嚇了一跳，
立刻潛入河底，沿著河床逃走了。

接著，我又在奧奇基里穆伊（Okikirmui）的汲水路，
只露出頭來。
奧奇基里穆伊的妹妹，同樣如神祇般美麗，
一手提著水桶，一手拿著香蒲。
我便問道：
「妳有父親嗎？妳有母親嗎？」

那少女驚訝地睜大眼睛，四處張望，
發現了我，臉上頓時充滿怒色，
「啊，可憎的扁頭，惡劣的扁頭，
竟敢愚弄人！狗兒們，上啊……」

話音未落，幾隻巨犬便衝了出來。

我見狀，想起方才的遭遇，
覺得十分可笑，正要潛入河底逃走，
沒想到那些狗竟然也跟著跳了下來，
對著我狂吠，並撕咬。
將我拖上岸，我的頭和身體
被牠們啃咬撕扯，最後我完全失去了意識。

突然，我醒了過來，
發現自己正坐在
一隻巨大的水獺的雙耳之間。

我明知薩瑪雲庫魯和奧奇基里穆伊
都沒有父母，卻還故意戲弄她們，
因此受到了懲罰，
被奧奇基里穆伊的狗殺死，
落得如此無聊、可悲的下場。

今後的水獺們啊，千萬不要再惡作劇了。

水獺如此講述著。

The Otter's Self-Sung Ballad
"Kapa ruru Kapa"

Kapa ruru Kapa
One day, as I frolicked down the stream,
I came to the watering path of Samayunkuru.
The sister of Samayunkuru, beautiful as a goddess,
Carried a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.
I peeked my head above the water's edge and asked:
"Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, surprised, widened her eyes and looked around,
Upon finding me, her face filled with rage,
"Ah, detestable flat-head, vile flat-head,
Daring to mock me! Dogs, get him!"

Before her words could fully escape, several giant dogs rushed out,
Snarling at me. Startled, I was,
I immediately dove to the river bottom, fleeing along the riverbed.

Then, I arrived at the watering path of Okikirmui,
Peeking my head above the water once more.
The sister of Okikirmui, equally divine in her beauty,
Held a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.
So I asked:
"Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden, surprised, widened her eyes and looked around,
Upon finding me, her face filled with rage,
"Ah, detestable flat-head, vile flat-head,
Daring to mock me! Dogs, get him!"

Before her words were done, several giant dogs rushed out.

Seeing this, remembering my previous encounter,
I found it quite amusing, and as I was about to dive and flee,
The dogs leaped into the water after me,
Barking madly and tearing at me.
They dragged me ashore, my head and body
Gnawed and ripped apart, until I lost all consciousness.

Suddenly, I awoke,
Finding myself seated
Between the ears of a giant otter.

Knowing full well that Samayunkuru and Okikirmui
Had no parents, yet I still teased them,
And thus, I was punished,
Killed by the dogs of Okikirmui,
Meeting such a pointless, pitiful end.

Otters of the future, never play such pranks again.

So spoke the otter.
