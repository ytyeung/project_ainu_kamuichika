Nephew, lend me a hand!\"\nI looked closer and saw it was indeed a walnut weir,\nIts juices polluting the stream with murky water.\nThe salmon, yearning to swim upstream,\nWere repelled by the walnut's bitter taint,\nAnd wept as they turned away. My rage ignited within me.\nI seized the mallet from the dwarf's grasp,\nAnd with a mighty blow, struck his spine,\nWith a resounding \"thwack!\" I shattered his back,\nSlew him, and cast his remains into the depths of hell.\nI tried to shake the walnut pile he had driven,\nIt seemed to stretch down, far beyond the sixth layer of hell.\n\nThen, summoning the strength of my loins, the power of my being,\nI snapped the pile from its roots,\nAnd cast it down into hell as well.\nFrom the source, clear winds began to blow, and pure waters flowed,\nAnd the salmon, who had wept and turned away,\nWere revitalized by the cleansing wind and water.\nThey rejoiced, they frolicked, they splashed,\nAnd swam upstream with renewed vigor.\nSeeing this, my heart was gladdened,\nAnd I turned my steps homeward, following the river's course.\nThus concludes the tale told by Okikirmui himself.",

        "input_prompt": "You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is a Japanese translation of a Ainu chant, sung by Ainu god telling his story. \nYou have 2 versions of English translations at hand.\n\nHere are your tasks:\n\n1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the Translations.\n2. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the accuracy of original meaning with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].\nWhere one star means \"Nonsense/No meaning preserved\",\ntwo stars mean \"Some meaning preserved, but not understandable\",\nthree stars mean \"Some meaning preserved and understandable\",\nfour stars mean \"Most meaning preserved with possibly few grammar mistakes\",\nand five stars mean \"Perfect meaning and grammar\".\n\n3. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the easiness to understanding with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].\nWhere one star means \"The text is completely not understandable.\",\ntwo stars mean \"Most part of text is not understandable.\",\nthree stars mean \"While the text is understandable, the word usage and grammar are difficult.\",\nfour stars mean \"Most part of text can be understood easily.\",\nand five stars mean \"All part of text can be understood easily.\".\n\n4. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the poetic flow with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].\nWhere one star means \"All the text is literal and plain.\",\ntwo stars mean \"Most part of text is literal.\",\nthree stars mean \"While the text flow is smooth, some part of the text is still literal and does not sound poetic.\",\nfour stars mean \"Most part of text is poetic.\",\nand five stars mean \"All part of the text is a poet and rhythmic. It is a chant.\".\n\n5. Choose a better translation according to the weighted score. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion (50%). Easiness to understanding is the second (30%). Poetic flow is the third (20%).\n6. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.\n\nKeep the original meaning accurately.\nIf a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.\n\nThis is the Japanese text.\n小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡\n「クツニサ クトンクトン」\n\nクツニサ クトンクトン\nある日に水源の方へ遊びに\n出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が\n胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに\n腰を曲げ曲げしている.\n私を見ると,いう事には,\n「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」\nという.見ると,胡桃の簗\nなものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水\nが流れて来て鮭どもが\n上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので\n泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので\n小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を\n引ったくり小男の腰の央を\n私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の\n腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい\n地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を\n揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の\n彼方まで届いている様だ.\nそれから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を\n出して,その杭を根本から\n折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.\n水源から清い風,清い水が\n流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.\n鮭どもは清い風,清い水に\n気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び\nながら,パチャパチャと\n上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし\n流れに沿うて帰って来た.と\n小さいオキキリムイが物語った.\n\nThis is the English Translation 1.\nKutunisa Kutonkuton,\nOne day, I went to play near the source of the river.\nThere, I found a little man building a weir of walnut wood.\nHe was bent over, hammering stakes.\nSeeing me, he said,\n\"Who are you?
