小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「クツニサ クトンクトン」

クツニサ クトンクトン
ある日に水源の方へ遊びに
出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が
胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに
腰を曲げ曲げしている.
私を見ると,いう事には,
「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」
という.見ると,胡桃の簗
なものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水
が流れて来て鮭どもが
上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので
泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので
小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を
引ったくり小男の腰の央を
私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の
腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい
地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を
揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の
彼方まで届いている様だ.
それから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を
出して,その杭を根本から
折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.
水源から清い風,清い水が
流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.
鮭どもは清い風,清い水に
気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び
ながら,パチャパチャと
上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし
流れに沿うて帰って来た.と
小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

This is the English Translation 1.
Kutunisa Kutonkuton,
One day, I went to play near the source of the river.
There, I found a little man building a weir of walnut wood.
He was bent over, hammering stakes.
Seeing me, he said,
"Who are you? Nephew, help me!"
I looked and saw it was a walnut weir.
Walnut water, muddy water,
flowed, and the salmon,
coming upstream, hated the walnut water
and wept as they turned back.
My anger flared, and I snatched
the mallet from the little man's hand.
I struck the small man's back with the mallet,
and the sound *pon* echoed.
I broke his back, killed him,
and kicked him down to hell.
I shook his walnut stake,
and it seemed to reach beyond six hells.
Then, I gathered the strength of my back,
the strength of my whole body,
and broke the stake from its root,
kicking it down to hell.
Clear wind, clear water,
began to flow from the source,
and the salmon, who had wept as they turned back,
revived in the clear wind and clear water.
They frolicked and laughed with great joy,
Splashing and playing as they swam upstream.
Seeing this, I was relieved,
and followed the stream home.
So told little Okikirmui.

This is the English Translation 2.
Kutsunisa Kutonkuton

One day, as I wandered to the source of the waters,
I beheld a small dwarf, hunched over,
Laboring to build a fish weir of walnut wood, driving piles with all his might.
He saw me and called out:
"Who are you? Nephew, lend me a hand!"
I looked closer and saw it was indeed a walnut weir,
Its juices polluting the stream with murky water.
The salmon, yearning to swim upstream,
Were repelled by the walnut's bitter taint,
And wept as they turned away. My rage ignited within me.
I seized the mallet from the dwarf's grasp,
And with a mighty blow, struck his spine,
With a resounding "thwack!" I shattered his back,
Slew him, and cast his remains into the depths of hell.
I tried to shake the walnut pile he had driven,
It seemed to stretch down, far beyond the sixth layer of hell.

Then, summoning the strength of my loins, the power of my being,
I snapped the pile from its roots,
And cast it down into hell as well.
From the source, clear winds began to blow, and pure waters flowed,
And the salmon, who had wept and turned away,
Were revitalized by the cleansing wind and water.
They rejoiced, they frolicked, they splashed,
And swam upstream with renewed vigor.
Seeing this, my heart was gladdened,
And I turned my steps homeward, following the river's course.
Thus concludes the tale told by Okikirmui himself.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4.7 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Clear and straightforward, but lacks some of the poetic flair of the original. Some phrases are a bit too literal.

#### Translation 2
More poetic and evocative, but some phrases might be slightly less accessible to a modern reader. Captures the tone and imagery well.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the poetic essence and vivid imagery of the original Japanese text more effectively than Translation 1. While Translation 1 is clear and understandable, it lacks the evocative language and rhythmic flow present in Translation 2. Translation 2 uses stronger verbs and descriptive phrases, creating a more engaging and immersive reading experience. The weighted score also reflects this assessment, prioritizing accuracy and poetic flow.
