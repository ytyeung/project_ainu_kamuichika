小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「クツニサ クトンクトン」

クツニサ クトンクトン
ある日に水源の方へ遊びに
出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が
胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに
腰を曲げ曲げしている.
私を見ると,いう事には,
「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」
という.見ると,胡桃の簗
なものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水
が流れて来て鮭どもが
上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので
泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので
小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を
引ったくり小男の腰の央を
私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の
腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい
地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を
揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の
彼方まで届いている様だ.
それから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を
出して,その杭を根本から
折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.
水源から清い風,清い水が
流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.
鮭どもは清い風,清い水に
気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び
ながら,パチャパチャと
上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし
流れに沿うて帰って来た.と
小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

This is the English Translation 1.
Kutunisa Kutonkuton,
One day, I went to play near the source of the river.
There, I saw a little man building a weir of walnut wood.
He was bent over, hammering stakes.
When he saw me, he said,
"Who are you? Nephew, please help me!"
I looked, and it was a walnut weir.
Walnut water, muddy water, flowed.
The salmon tried to swim upstream,
but they hated the walnut water
and cried as they turned back.
I was furious.
I snatched the mallet from the little man
and struck him in the small of his back.
I struck so hard it echoed, "Pon!"
I broke his back, killed him,
and kicked him down to hell.
I shook his walnut stakes,
and they seemed to reach beyond six hells.
Then, with all the strength in my back and body,
I broke the stakes from their roots
and kicked them down to hell.
Clear wind and clear water flowed from the source,
and the salmon, who had cried as they left,
revived in the clear wind and water.
They frolicked and laughed with great joy,
Splashing and swimming upstream.
Seeing this, I was relieved
and returned along the river.
So told little Okikirmui.

This is the English Translation 2.
Kutsunisa Kutonkuton,

One day, as I wandered to the source of the water,
I saw a small boy, hunched over,
Trying to build a weir of walnut wood, driving piles.
He saw me and said:
"Who are you? Could you be my nephew? Give me a hand."
I looked, and it was a weir of walnut,
And the water of the walnut, a muddy torrent,
The salmon tried to swim upstream, but hated the walnut water,
Crying, they turned back. My anger flared,
I snatched the mallet from the boy's hand,
And struck his waist with a mighty blow,
The sound like thunder. I broke the boy's
Spine, killing him,
And kicked him into hell. I shook
The walnut pile, as if to reach the sixth level of hell.

Then, I used all my strength, all my power,
To break the pile from its roots,
And kicked it into hell. 
A clear breeze came to the source of the water, the water flowed clear,
The salmon no longer cried,
Regained their vitality, rejoiced, and played,
Splashing water,
Swimming upstream. Seeing this, my heart was comforted,
And I returned along the stream. So spoke Little Okikirmui.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.8 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3.5 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 provides a clear and understandable narrative. It uses simple language and maintains a consistent flow. However, it could benefit from a slightly more poetic touch to better reflect the chant-like nature of the original Ainu text.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 has some awkward phrasing and a slightly less smooth narrative flow compared to Translation 1. Some word choices, while attempting to be more evocative, end up sounding unnatural. However, it does capture some of the raw emotion and energy of the original text.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 is slightly better because it maintains a clearer narrative flow and avoids some of the awkward phrasing present in Translation 2. While both capture the essence of the story, Translation 1's language is more straightforward and easier to follow. The weighted score also reflects this preference, though the difference is marginal.
