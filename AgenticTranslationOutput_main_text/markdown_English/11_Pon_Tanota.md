小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「この砂赤い赤い」

〔この砂赤い赤い〕
ある日に流れをさかのぼって遊びに
出かけたら,悪魔の子に出会った.
いつでも悪魔の子は様子が美しい
顔が美しい.黒い衣を着けて
胡桃くるみの小弓に胡桃の小矢を持っていて
私を見ると,ニコニコして
いうことには,
「小オキキリムイ,遊ぼう.
さあこれから,魚の根を絶やして見せよう.」
と言って,胡桃の小弓に胡桃の小矢を
番つがえ水源の方へ矢を射放すと,
水源から胡桃の水,濁った水が
流れ出し,鮭どもが上って来ると
胡桃の水が厭なので泣きながら
引き返して流れて行く.悪魔の子は
それをニコニコしている.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
私の持っていた,銀の小弓に銀の小矢を
番え水源へ矢を射はなすと
水源から銀の水,清い水が
流れ出し,泣きながら流れて行った
鮭どもは清い水に元気を恢復し
大笑いをして遊びさわいで
パチャパチャ川を上って行った.
すると,悪魔の子は,持前の癇癪かんしゃくを
顔に表して,
「本当にお前そんな事をするなら,鹿の根を
絶やして見せよう.」と云って,
胡桃の小弓に胡桃の小矢を番え
大空を射ると,山の木原から
胡桃の風,つむじ風が吹いて来て
山の木原から,牡鹿の群は別に
牝鹿の群はまた別に,風に吹き上げられ
ずーっと天空へきれいにならんで上って行く.
悪魔の子はニコニコしている.
それを見た私はかっと癪にさわったので
銀の小弓に銀の小矢を
番えて,鹿の群のあとへ矢を射放すと,
天上から,銀の風,清い風が
吹き降り,牡鹿の群は
別に,牝鹿の群はまた別に,
山の木原の上へ吹き下された.
すると,悪魔の子は
持前の癇癪を顔に現し,
「生意気な,本当に
お前そんな事をするなら,力競べをやろう.」
と云いながら上衣を脱いだ.
私も薄衣一枚になって
組み付いた.彼も私に組み付いた.それからは
互に下にしたり上にしあったり相撲をとったが,
大へんに悪魔の子が力のある事には
驚いた.けれども,とうとう,ある時間に,
私は腰の力,からだの力を
みんな出して,悪魔の子を
肩の上まで引っ担ぎ,
山の岩の上へ彼を打ちつけた音が
がんと響いた.殺してしまって地獄へ
踏み落したあとはしんと静まり返った.
それが済んで,私は流れに沿って帰って来ると,
川の中では鮭どもが笑う声
遊ぶ声がかまびすしくのぼって来るのが
パチャパチャきこえる.山の木原では,
牡鹿ども,牝鹿どもが笑う声
遊ぶ声がそこら一ぱいになって
そこにここに物を
食べている.私はそれを見て
安心をし,私の家へ
帰って来た.
と,小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

This is the English Translation 1.
Little Okikirmui sang this song himself:
"This sand, red, so red."

This sand, red, so red.
One day, venturing upstream for play,
I encountered a child of the devil.
Always, the devil's child is fair to see,
Beautiful of face, clad in black,
Holding a small bow of walnut, with arrows of walnut.
Seeing me, he smiled and said,
"Little Okikirmui, let us play.
Now, I shall show you how to cut off the fish's source."
So saying, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot towards the source of the river.
From the source flowed walnut water, turbid and foul,
And the salmon, ascending, abhorred the walnut water,
Weeping, they turned back and drifted away.
The devil's child smiled to see it.
Seeing this, my anger flared,
And I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow,
And shot towards the source of the river.
From the source flowed silver water, pure and clear,
And the salmon, who had wept as they drifted away,
Regained their vigor in the clear water,
Laughing and frolicking, they splashed upstream.
Then, the devil's child, his temper flaring,
Showed his rage upon his face, saying,
"If you truly do such things, I shall cut off the deer's source."
So saying, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot into the vast sky.
From the mountain forests blew a walnut wind, a whirlwind,
And from the mountain forests, the stags apart,
The does apart, were lifted by the wind,
Rising in neat rows into the heavens.
The devil's child smiled to see it.
Seeing this, my anger blazed,
And I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow,
And shot after the deer.
From the heavens blew a silver wind, a pure wind,
And the stags apart, the does apart,
Were blown down upon the mountain forests.
Then, the devil's child,
His temper flaring, showed his rage upon his face, saying,
"Insolent one, if you truly
Do such things, let us test our strength."
So saying, he removed his upper garment.
I, too, in a thin robe, grappled with him.
He grappled with me. Then,
We wrestled, each trying to throw the other,
And I was amazed by the devil's child's strength.
But at last, at a certain moment,
I gathered all the strength of my loins, the strength of my body,
And lifted the devil's child
Upon my shoulders,
And the sound of him striking the mountain rocks
Rang out with a clang. Having slain him and cast him into hell,
All was silent.
That done, I returned along the stream,
And from the river rose the clamorous sound
Of salmon laughing and playing, splashing.
In the mountain forests,
The stags and does laughed and played,
Filling the air as they grazed here and there.
Seeing this, I was at peace,
And returned to my home.
So, little Okikirmui told his tale.

This is the English Translation 2.
The gravel, red and red,
One day, as I journeyed upstream for leisure,
I encountered the child of a demon.
Always so fair was this demon child,
With delicate features. Clad in garments of black,
He wielded a small bow of walnut, matched with arrows of walnut.
Upon seeing me, he grinned and said:
"Okikirmui, come and play!
See how I shall cut off the fishes' path of life."

Having spoken, he notched a walnut arrow upon his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the source of the waters.
In an instant, walnut water gushed forth from the source, turbid and foul.
The salmon, striving upstream,
Wept, for they loathed the walnut water,
And retreated, flowing back downstream. The demon child, beholding this,
Merely laughed in triumph.

Seeing this scene, my anger flared,
And I drew my small bow of silver, notched with an arrow of silver,
And shot it towards the source of the waters.
Thereupon, silver water gushed forth from the source, clear and sweet.
The salmon, weeping as they departed,
Regained their vigor in the clear silver water,
Laughing and frolicking,
"Pacha pacha" as they swam upstream.

The demon child's face darkened with rage,
Revealing his innate, impetuous nature,
"If you insist on this, I shall cut off the deer's path of life."
Saying so, he notched a walnut arrow upon his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the heavens.
In a flash, walnut wind blew from the mountain's wood, 
Forming gusts of whirlwind.
In the mountain's wood, stags in droves,
does in droves, were caught in the fierce wind,
Rising neatly into the sky.
The demon child laughed in triumph.

Seeing this, I was consumed by rage,
And I notched a silver arrow upon my silver bow,
And shot it towards the departing deer.
In an instant, silver wind blew from the sky, crisp and refreshing.
Stags in droves, does in droves,
Were blown back to the mountain's wood.

The demon child's face darkened with rage once more,
Revealing his innate, impetuous nature,
"Arrogant fool, if you insist on this,
We shall test our strength!"
Saying so, he removed his upper garments.
I, too, was left in but a thin layer of clothing,
And grappled with him. He embraced me tightly,
We wrestled, sometimes I gained the upper hand, sometimes he did.
I was astonished by the demon child's great strength.
Yet, finally, in one moment,
I summoned the strength of my waist and my entire being,
And lifted the demon child above my head,
And slammed him hard upon the mountain rocks,
With a resounding "ganto".
I slew him, and kicked him into hell,
And silence fell all around.

When all was done, I returned along the river,
And heard only the laughter of the salmon in the river,
Their frolicking sounds of "pacha pacha".
In the mountain's wood, the laughter of stags and does,
Their frolicking sounds filled the air,
They grazed leisurely there and here.
Seeing this scene, I felt at peace,
And returned to my home.

Thus spoke Okikirmui.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.2 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is generally accurate but lacks some of the poetic flair present in the original Japanese. Some phrases are a bit too literal, and the overall tone is less evocative.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is more poetic and captures the spirit of the Ainu chant more effectively. The word choices are more evocative, and the rhythm is generally better. The inclusion of 'pacha pacha' is a nice touch.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the poetic essence and cultural nuances of the Ainu chant more effectively than Translation 1. While both translations are understandable, Translation 2 uses more evocative language and retains a better sense of rhythm and flow, making it a superior choice overall. The inclusion of "pacha pacha" also helps to retain the original feel.
