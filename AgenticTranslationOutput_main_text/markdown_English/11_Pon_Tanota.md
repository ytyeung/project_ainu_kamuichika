小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「この砂赤い赤い」

〔この砂赤い赤い〕
ある日に流れをさかのぼって遊びに
出かけたら,悪魔の子に出会った.
いつでも悪魔の子は様子が美しい
顔が美しい.黒い衣を着けて
胡桃くるみの小弓に胡桃の小矢を持っていて
私を見ると,ニコニコして
いうことには,
「小オキキリムイ,遊ぼう.
さあこれから,魚の根を絶やして見せよう.」
と言って,胡桃の小弓に胡桃の小矢を
番つがえ水源の方へ矢を射放すと,
水源から胡桃の水,濁った水が
流れ出し,鮭どもが上って来ると
胡桃の水が厭なので泣きながら
引き返して流れて行く.悪魔の子は
それをニコニコしている.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
私の持っていた,銀の小弓に銀の小矢を
番え水源へ矢を射はなすと
水源から銀の水,清い水が
流れ出し,泣きながら流れて行った
鮭どもは清い水に元気を恢復し
大笑いをして遊びさわいで
パチャパチャ川を上って行った.
すると,悪魔の子は,持前の癇癪かんしゃくを
顔に表して,
「本当にお前そんな事をするなら,鹿の根を
絶やして見せよう.」と云って,
胡桃の小弓に胡桃の小矢を番え
大空を射ると,山の木原から
胡桃の風,つむじ風が吹いて来て
山の木原から,牡鹿の群は別に
牝鹿の群はまた別に,風に吹き上げられ
ずーっと天空へきれいにならんで上って行く.
悪魔の子はニコニコしている.
それを見た私はかっと癪にさわったので
銀の小弓に銀の小矢を
番えて,鹿の群のあとへ矢を射放すと,
天上から,銀の風,清い風が
吹き降り,牡鹿の群は
別に,牝鹿の群はまた別に,
山の木原の上へ吹き下された.
すると,悪魔の子は
持前の癇癪を顔に現し,
「生意気な,本当に
お前そんな事をするなら,力競べをやろう.」
と云いながら上衣を脱いだ.
私も薄衣一枚になって
組み付いた.彼も私に組み付いた.それからは
互に下にしたり上にしあったり相撲をとったが,
大へんに悪魔の子が力のある事には
驚いた.けれども,とうとう,ある時間に,
私は腰の力,からだの力を
みんな出して,悪魔の子を
肩の上まで引っ担ぎ,
山の岩の上へ彼を打ちつけた音が
がんと響いた.殺してしまって地獄へ
踏み落したあとはしんと静まり返った.
それが済んで,私は流れに沿って帰って来ると,
川の中では鮭どもが笑う声
遊ぶ声がかまびすしくのぼって来るのが
パチャパチャきこえる.山の木原では,
牡鹿ども,牝鹿どもが笑う声
遊ぶ声がそこら一ぱいになって
そこにここに物を
食べている.私はそれを見て
安心をし,私の家へ
帰って来た.
と,小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

This is the English Translation 1.
“This sand is red, so red.”

One day, as I went playing up the stream,
I met a child of the devil.
Always, the devil's child is beautiful in appearance,
Beautiful in face, wearing black robes,
Holding a walnut bow and walnut arrows.
Seeing me, he smiled and said,
“Little Okikirmui, let's play.
Now, I'll show you how to cut off the fish's roots.”
Saying this, he notched a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the source of the river.
From the source flowed walnut water, turbid water,
And when the salmon tried to swim upstream,
The walnut water disgusted them, and crying,
They turned back and flowed away. The devil's child
Smiled at this.
Seeing this, I was angered,
And notched a silver arrow to my silver bow,
And shot it towards the source of the river.
From the source flowed silver water, clear water,
And the salmon, who had been crying,
Regained their strength in the clear water,
And laughing loudly, playing and frolicking,
They splashed and swam up the river.
Then, the devil's child, with his inherent temper,
Showed it on his face, saying,
“If you really do such things, I'll show you how to cut off the deer's roots.”
Saying this, he notched a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot it into the sky. From the mountain's fields,
A walnut wind, a whirlwind, blew,
And from the mountain's fields, the male deer herds separately,
And the female deer herds separately, were blown up by the wind,
Rising neatly into the sky.
The devil's child smiled at this.
Seeing this, I was enraged,
And notched a silver arrow to my silver bow,
And shot it after the deer herds.
From the sky, a silver wind, a clear wind,
Blew down, and the male deer herds separately,
And the female deer herds separately,
Were blown down onto the mountain's fields.
Then, the devil's child,
Showing his inherent temper on his face, said,
“Insolent one, if you really
Do such things, let's have a contest of strength.”
Saying this, he took off his coat.
I also became only wearing a thin robe
And grappled. He grappled with me. From then on,
We wrestled, sometimes below, sometimes above,
But I was surprised at how strong the devil's child was.
However, finally, at a certain moment,
I used all the strength in my waist, all the strength in my body,
And lifted the devil's child
Up to my shoulders,
And the sound of me slamming him onto the mountain rocks
Echoed loudly. After killing him and
Kicking him into hell, it became silent.
That done, as I returned along the stream,
From the river, the voices of the laughing salmon,
The voices of playing, rose noisily,
Splashing. In the mountain's fields,
The voices of the male deer and female deer laughing,
The voices of playing, filled everywhere,
Eating things here and there. Seeing this, I
Felt relieved, and to my home
I returned.
So, little Okikirmui told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
[This sand, so red]
One day, as I journeyed upstream for leisure,
I encountered the child of a demon.
Always so fair was the demon's child,
With a visage of delicate beauty. Clad in garments of black,
A small bow of walnut wood he held, with arrows to match.
Seeing me, he grinned and said:
"Okikirmui, come and play!
See how I shall sever the source of the fish."
With these words, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the spring of the waters.
The spring gushed forth with walnut water, turbid and foul,
The salmon swam against the current,
But, loathing the walnut water, they wept,
And turned away. The demon's child, beholding this,
Merely grinned.
My rage ignited at this sight,
I drew forth my small bow of silver,
Nocked a silver arrow, and shot it towards the spring.
The spring gushed forth with silver water, clear and sweet,
The salmon, weeping as they retreated,
Regained their vigor in the clear silver water,
Laughing and playing, splashing and frolicking,
Swimming against the current. The demon's child, beholding this,
Revealed the impatience born within him,
"If you insist, then I shall sever the source of the deer."
So saying, he nocked a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,
And shot it towards the sky,
A walnut wind swept through the trees of the mountains,
Forming a whirlwind.
Among the trees of the mountains, stags in droves,
Does in droves, were lifted by the wind,
Rising neatly into the sky.
The demon's child grinned.
My fury knew no bounds,
I nocked a silver arrow to my silver bow,
And shot it towards the departing deer.
A silver wind descended from the heavens, clear and refreshing,
Stags in droves,
Does in droves,
Were blown back to the trees of the mountains.
The demon's child, beholding this,
Once more revealed the impatience born within him,
"Insolent fool, if you insist
On this, then let us test our strength."
With these words, he removed his upper garment.
I, too, was left in but a thin robe,
And grappled with him. He held me tight.
From then on, we wrestled, each striving for dominance,
At times I gained the upper hand, at times he did,
But the demon child's strength was truly astonishing.
Yet, in the end,
At a certain moment, I unleashed the power of my loins,
The power of my entire being,
And hoisted the demon child upon my shoulders,
Slamming him hard upon the mountain rocks,
With a deafening crash.
Having slain him, and cast him into hell,
Silence fell all around.
When all was done, I returned along the river,
The laughter of the salmon in the river,
The sounds of their play, were lively and joyous,
Splashing and frolicking, reaching my ears.
Among the trees of the mountains,
The laughter of the stags and does,
The sounds of their play, filled the mountains,
There they were, here they were,
Leisurely foraging. Seeing this,
I felt at peace, and returned to
My home.
So spoke Okikirmui.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4.7 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation is straightforward and easy to understand, but it lacks the poetic flow and archaic tone of the original chant. Some of the word choices are too modern and do not capture the spirit of the Ainu narrative style.

#### Translation 2
This translation captures the poetic essence and archaic tone of the original Ainu chant more effectively. The use of richer vocabulary and sentence structures creates a more immersive and evocative reading experience. However, some phrases could be simplified for better understanding.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the poetic essence and archaic tone of the original Ainu chant more effectively than Translation 1. While Translation 1 is more straightforward and easier to understand, it lacks the lyrical quality and nuanced vocabulary that are crucial for conveying the spirit of the chant. Translation 2 uses richer vocabulary and sentence structures, creating a more immersive and evocative reading experience. The weighted score also reflects this assessment, prioritizing accuracy and poetic flow.
