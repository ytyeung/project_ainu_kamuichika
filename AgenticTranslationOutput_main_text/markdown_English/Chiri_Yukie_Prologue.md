序

その昔この広い北海道は,私たちの先祖の自由の天地でありました.天真爛漫な稚児の様に,美しい大自然に抱擁されてのんびりと楽しく生活していた彼等は,真に自然の寵児,なんという幸福な人だちであったでしょう.
冬の陸には林野をおおう深雪を蹴って,天地を凍らす寒気を物ともせず山又山をふみ越えて熊を狩り,夏の海には涼風泳ぐみどりの波,白い鴎の歌を友に木の葉の様な小舟を浮べてひねもす魚を漁り,花咲く春は軟らかな陽の光を浴びて,永久に囀さえずる小鳥と共に歌い暮して蕗ふきとり蓬よもぎ摘み,紅葉の秋は野分に穂揃うすすきをわけて,宵まで鮭とる篝かがりも消え,谷間に友呼ぶ鹿の音を外に,円まどかな月に夢を結ぶ.嗚呼なんという楽しい生活でしょう.平和の境,それも今は昔,夢は破れて幾十年,この地は急速な変転をなし,山野は村に,村は町にと次第々々に開けてゆく.
太古ながらの自然の姿も何時の間にか影薄れて,野辺に山辺に嬉々として暮していた多くの民の行方も亦いずこ.僅かに残る私たち同族は,進みゆく世のさまにただ驚きの眼をみはるばかり.しかもその眼からは一挙一動宗教的感念に支配されていた昔の人の美しい魂の輝きは失われて,不安に充ち不平に燃え,鈍りくらんで行手も見わかず,よその御慈悲にすがらねばならぬ,あさましい姿,おお亡びゆくもの......それは今の私たちの名,なんという悲しい名前を私たちは持っているのでしょう.
その昔,幸福な私たちの先祖は,自分のこの郷土が末にこうした惨めなありさまに変ろうなどとは,露ほども想像し得なかったのでありましょう.
時は絶えず流れる,世は限りなく進展してゆく.激しい競争場裡に敗残の醜をさらしている今の私たちの中からも,いつかは,二人三人でも強いものが出て来たら,進みゆく世と歩をならべる日も,やがては来ましょう.それはほんとうに私たちの切なる望み,明暮あけくれ祈っている事で御座います.
けれど......愛する私たちの先祖が起伏す日頃互いに意を通ずる為に用いた多くの言語,言い古し,残し伝えた多くの美しい言葉,それらのものもみんな果敢なく,亡びゆく弱きものと共に消失せてしまうのでしょうか.おおそれはあまりにいたましい名残惜しい事で御座います.
アイヌに生れアイヌ語の中に生いたった私は,雨の宵,雪の夜,暇ある毎に打集って私たちの先祖が語り興じたいろいろな物語の中極く小さな話の一つ二つを拙ない筆に書連ねました.
私たちを知って下さる多くの方に読んでいただく事が出来ますならば,私は,私たちの同族祖先と共にほんとうに無限の喜び,無上の幸福に存じます.

大正十一年三月一日

知里幸惠

This is the English Translation 1.
Long ago, this vast Hokkaido was the free land of our ancestors. Like innocent children, embraced by the beautiful wilderness, they lived a life of leisure and joy. Truly, they were the darlings of nature, how fortunate they were! In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the land, braving the freezing cold as they crossed mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they floated in leaf-like canoes on the green waves where cool breezes played, accompanied by the songs of white gulls, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering *fuki* and *yomogi*. In the autumn of red leaves, they parted the fields of *susuki* with their ripening ears in the autumn wind, the bonfires for catching salmon disappearing until late at night. With only the sound of deer calling to their companions in the valleys, they wove dreams under the round moon. Ah, what a joyful life it was! A peaceful realm, now a thing of the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone rapid transformation. Mountains and fields have gradually opened up into villages, and villages into towns. The ancient natural landscape has faded away unnoticed, and the whereabouts of the many people who once lived happily in the fields and mountains are also unknown. The few of us who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Moreover, the beautiful souls of the people of old, whose every action was governed by religious sentiments, have lost their brilliance from those eyes, filled with anxiety and burning with discontent, dulled and darkened, unable to see the way forward, forced to rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now, what a sad name we bear. In the past, our happy ancestors could not have imagined, even in the slightest, that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state. Time flows ceaselessly, the world advances without end. Even from among us, who are now displaying the ugliness of defeat in this fierce arena of competition, someday, if even two or three strong individuals emerge, the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our earnest wish, something we pray for day and night. But... will the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other in their daily lives, the many beautiful words that have been spoken, preserved, and passed down, all vanish along with the weak who are dying out? Oh, that would be too painful and regrettable. Born as an Ainu and raised in the Ainu language, I have, on rainy evenings and snowy nights, whenever I have had the time, gathered together and written down in my clumsy hand one or two of the very small stories from the various tales that our ancestors told and enjoyed. If many people who know us can read this, I will feel truly infinite joy and supreme happiness, together with our ancestors. March 1, 1922 Chiri Yukie

Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was our ancestors' free domain. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily, truly nature's darlings, how blessed they were! In winter, they kicked away the thick snow covering the forests, braving the icy cold to hunt bears across mountain ranges. In summer, they sailed on leaf-like boats on the breezy, green-waved sea, accompanied by the songs of white seagulls, fishing all day long. In the flower-filled spring, they basked in the gentle sunlight, celebrating with the ever-singing birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the autumn of fiery red leaves, they parted the wind-swept, neatly aligned miscanthus grass, dreaming under the round moon to the sound of deer calling to their companions in the valleys, until the bonfires for salmon fishing died out late at night. Ah, what a joyful life! A peaceful realm, now all in the past. Dreams shattered for decades, this land has undergone rapid transformations, mountains and fields turning into villages, villages into towns, gradually being developed and cultivated. The primeval natural scenery has faded into obscurity. Where have the many people who lived happily in the fields and mountains gone? We, the remaining few of our tribe, can only stare in astonishment at the ever-advancing world. And from those eyes, the light of beautiful souls, once governed by religious beliefs and shining in every action, has vanished, replaced by unease and smoldering discontent, becoming dull and dim, unable to see the road ahead, forced to rely on the mercy of others, what a pitiful sight. Ah, things on the verge of extinction... that is now our name, what a sorrowful name we bear! Once, our happy ancestors could not have imagined even a little that their homeland would become such a desolate place. Time flows on, the world develops infinitely. In the fierce arena of competition, among us who expose the ugliness of defeat, someday, perhaps two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will come when we can keep pace with the ever-advancing times. That is our fervent wish, what we pray for day and night. But... our beloved ancestors, the many languages they used to communicate with each other in daily life, the many beautiful words passed down orally, will all those things mercilessly disappear along with the weak who are about to perish? Ah, that is truly too sad, too regrettable. As an Ainu, raised in the Ainu language, on rainy nights, on snowy nights, whenever I have free time, I gather together and record, with clumsy strokes, a very small part of the various stories told by our ancestors. If it can be read by many who understand us, I, along with our ancestral tribe, will feel true, boundless joy, supreme happiness.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4.7 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Generally accurate and understandable, but some phrases are slightly less evocative than the original. The translation of cultural terms like 'fuki' and 'yomogi' by keeping the original words is a good choice.

#### Translation 2
Captures the poetic tone and cultural context well. The descriptions are vivid and emotionally resonant. The translation flows smoothly and is easy to understand.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the nuances and poetic elements of the original Japanese text more effectively than Translation 1. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 2's word choices and phrasing often better reflect the emotional tone and cultural context of the passage. For example, the description of the autumn scene and the lament for the loss of Ainu language and culture are more evocative in Translation 2.
