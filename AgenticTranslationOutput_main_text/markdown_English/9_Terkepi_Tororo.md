蛙が自らを歌った謡
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」

トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!
「ある日に,草原を飛び廻って
遊んでいるうちに見ると,
一軒の家があるので戸口へ行って
見ると,家の内に宝の積んである側に
高床がある.その高床の上に
一人の若者が鞘を刻んでうつむいて
いたので,私は悪戯をしかけようと思って敷居の上に
坐って,「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴いた,ところが,彼の若者は刀持つ手を上げ
私を見ると,ニッコリ笑って,
「それはお前の謡かえ? お前の喜びの歌かえ?
もっと聞きたいね.」というので
私はよろこんで「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴くと,彼の若者のいう事には,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」
私はそれをきいて嬉しく思い下座の方の
炉縁の上へピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴くと
彼の若者のいうことには,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」それを聞くと私は,
本当に嬉しくなって,上座の方の炉縁の
隅のところへピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴いたら
突然!彼の若者がパッと起ち
上ったかと思うと,大きな薪の燃えさしを
取り上げて私の上へ投げつけた音は
体の前がふさがったように思われて,それっきり
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たら
芥捨あくすて場の末に,一つの腹のふくれた蛙が
死んでいて,その耳と耳との間に私はすわっていた.
よく見ると,ただの人間の家
だと思ったのは,オキキリムイ,神の様に
強い方の家なのであった,そして
オキキリムイだという事も知らずに
私が悪戯をしたのであった.
私はもう今この様につまらない死方,悪い死方
をするのだから,これからの
蛙たちよ,決して,人間たちに悪戯をするのではないよ.
と,ふくれた蛙が云いながら死んでしまった.

A Frog's Self-Sung Song
"Tōroro Hanroku Hanroku!"

Tōroro Hanroku Hanroku!
"One day, as I hopped and played in the meadow,
I saw a house. I went to the doorway,
And inside, beside a pile of treasures,
Was a raised platform. On that platform,
A young man was carving a sheath, head bowed.
I thought to play a trick, so I sat on the threshold
And sang, 'Tōroro Hanroku Hanroku!'
But the young man raised the hand that held his knife,
Looked at me, and smiled gently.
'Is that your song? Your song of joy?
I'd like to hear more,' he said.
So, delighted, I sang, 'Tōroro Hanroku Hanroku!'
Then the young man said to me,
'Is that your Yukara? Your Sakehau?
I'd like to hear it closer.'
Hearing this, I was pleased and hopped down
To the edge of the hearth,
And sang, 'Tōroro Hanroku Hanroku!'
The young man said,
'Is that your Yukara? Your Sakehau?
I'd like to hear it closer still!' Hearing that, I,
Truly delighted, hopped to the corner
Of the hearth on the upper side,
And sang, 'Tōroro Hanroku Hanroku!'
Suddenly!
The young man leaped up,
And as I looked up, he grabbed a large, burning log
And threw it at me! The sound was like
The world in front of me had closed off, and after that
I didn't know what happened.
When I came to, I was
At the edge of the garbage heap, a frog with a swollen belly
Lay dead, and I was sitting between its ears.
Looking closely, I realized that what I thought
Was just a human's house was actually the home of
Okikirmui, a god of great power.
And without knowing it was Okikirmui,
I had played a trick on him.
Now I am dying such a meaningless, terrible death,
So, frogs of the future,
Never, ever play tricks on humans."
So spoke the swollen frog as it died.

Tororo Hankoku Hankoku!

Tororo Hankoku Hankoku!
One day, as I frolicked upon the plains,
I chanced upon a dwelling and peered within.
There, treasures filled one side, and a high platform stood,
Upon which a youth sat, carving a sheath of wood.
A mischievous whim seized me, and I sat upon the sill,
Crying, "Tororo Hankoku Hankoku!" with a thrill.
But the youth, he raised his hand that held the knife,
And looked at me, and smiled, as if to life,
"Is this your song? Your joyful sound?
I long to hear it more, upon this ground."
Delighted, I cried, "Tororo Hankoku Hankoku!" with glee,
And the youth spoke again, so gently to me,
"Is this your yukar? Your sakehau so sweet?
I wish to hear it closer, my joy complete."
My heart swelled with joy, and I leaped down with grace,
To the hearth's edge below, in that humble place,
Crying, "Tororo Hankoku Hankoku!" with might,
And the youth spoke again, with eyes so bright,
"Is this your yukar? Your sakehau so clear?
I wish to hear it closer, banishing all fear."
At these words, I was overjoyed, and with a bound,
I leaped to the hearth's corner, safe and sound,
Crying, "Tororo Hankoku Hankoku!" with cheer,
But suddenly! The youth rose up, drawing near!
I thought he would approach, but instead, he seized,
A burning log, immense, my spirit displeased,
He hurled it at me, a sound that blocked my way,
And after that, I knew nothing of the day.
When I awoke, dazed and in a fright,
I found myself at the dump's very end, in dim light,
A frog lay dead, its belly swollen and vast,
And I sat between its ears, my die was cast.
I looked around, and realized with dread,
This was no ordinary home, as I had instead,
Believed, but the house of Okikirmui, so grand,
A being of power, like a god in the land!
And I, in ignorance, had played a trick,
On Okikirmui himself, with a foolish flick.
Now I die this wretched, insignificant death,
So, frogs of the future, take heed with each breath,
Never play tricks on humans, I implore,
Or you may suffer a fate to deplore."
The swollen frog spoke thus, and then expired,
A lesson learned too late, a life retired.
