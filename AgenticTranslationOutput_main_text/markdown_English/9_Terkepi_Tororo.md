蛙が自らを歌った謡
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」

トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!
「ある日に,草原を飛び廻って
遊んでいるうちに見ると,
一軒の家があるので戸口へ行って
見ると,家の内に宝の積んである側に
高床がある.その高床の上に
一人の若者が鞘を刻んでうつむいて
いたので,私は悪戯をしかけようと思って敷居の上に
坐って,「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴いた,ところが,彼の若者は刀持つ手を上げ
私を見ると,ニッコリ笑って,
「それはお前の謡かえ? お前の喜びの歌かえ?
もっと聞きたいね.」というので
私はよろこんで「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴くと,彼の若者のいう事には,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」
私はそれをきいて嬉しく思い下座の方の
炉縁の上へピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴くと
彼の若者のいうことには,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」それを聞くと私は,
本当に嬉しくなって,上座の方の炉縁の
隅のところへピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴いたら
突然!彼の若者がパッと起ち
上ったかと思うと,大きな薪の燃えさしを
取り上げて私の上へ投げつけた音は
体の前がふさがったように思われて,それっきり
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たら
芥捨あくすて場の末に,一つの腹のふくれた蛙が
死んでいて,その耳と耳との間に私はすわっていた.
よく見ると,ただの人間の家
だと思ったのは,オキキリムイ,神の様に
強い方の家なのであった,そして
オキキリムイだという事も知らずに
私が悪戯をしたのであった.
私はもう今この様につまらない死方,悪い死方
をするのだから,これからの
蛙たちよ,決して,人間たちに悪戯をするのではないよ.
と,ふくれた蛙が云いながら死んでしまった.

"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!" 

Toro ro hanroku hanroku!
"One day, as I hopped and played in the meadow,
I saw a house. I went to the doorway,
and inside, beside a pile of treasures,
was a raised platform. Upon that platform
Sat a young man, carving a sheath, head bowed.
I thought to play a trick, so I sat on the threshold
and sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
But the young man raised the hand that held his knife,
Looked at me, and smiled gently.
"Is that your song? Your song of joy?
I would hear more," he said.
So, delighted, I sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
Then the young man spoke again:
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I would hear it closer."
Hearing this, I was pleased and hopped down
to the edge of the hearth,
Singing, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
And the young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I would hear it closer still!"
Hearing this, I was truly happy, and hopped
to the corner of the hearth, near the seat of honor,
And sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
Suddenly! The young man leaped up,
And with a swift motion,
Seized a large, burning log
And threw it upon me! The sound was
as if the world before me had closed, and after that,
I knew nothing more.
When I awoke,
At the edge of the refuse heap,
Lay a dead frog with a swollen belly,
And between its ears, I sat.
Then I saw clearly, that what I thought
was a simple human dwelling
Was the home of Okikirmui, a god of immense power.
And without knowing it was Okikirmui,
I had played my trick.
Now I die this meaningless, wretched death.
So, frogs of the future,
Never, ever play tricks on humans."
And with those words, the swollen frog died.

Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!

Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!

One day, as I frolicked and leaped across the plains,
I spied a dwelling and approached its entrance.
Inside, I saw a treasure-filled room,
And within it, a raised platform.
Upon this platform,
A young man was bent, carving a sheath.
Seized by mischief, I sat upon the threshold,
Chanting, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
Unexpectedly, the young man raised his hand holding the knife,
Looked at me, and smiled,
"Is that your song? Your joyful sound?
I long to hear more."
Pleased, I chanted again, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
The young man then said:
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I wish to hear it from closer by."
Even more delighted, I leaped down,
Towards the hearth,
Chanting, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
The young man spoke again:
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I wish to hear it from even closer."
Hearing this, I was overjoyed, and I leaped towards the corner
near the hearth,
Chanting, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
Suddenly! The young man rose swiftly,
As if in flight, seized a large, burning log,
And hurled it at me, the sound
As if something blocked the front of my body, and after that
I knew nothing more.
When I came to,
I found myself at the edge of a garbage dump, a bloated frog
Lay dead, and I was seated between its ears.
Looking closer, I realized the home I thought ordinary,
Was the dwelling of Okikirmui, one as powerful as a god.
And I,
Unaware of Okikirmui's identity,
Played a trick on him.
Now I shall die in such a wretched, insignificant way,
So, frogs of the future,
Never play tricks on humans."
Thus spoke the bloated frog, and breathed no more.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3.7 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation maintains a good balance between accuracy and readability. The language is relatively simple and easy to understand, while still capturing the essence of the original story. The repetition of "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!" is preserved, which is important for maintaining the chant-like quality of the text.

#### Translation 2
This translation is also quite good, but some of the word choices are slightly less natural in English. For example, "frolicked and leaped across the plains" is a bit more stilted than "hopped and played in the meadow." However, it still conveys the meaning accurately.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 and Translation 2 are very similar. Translation 1 is slightly better because it uses more natural English phrasing in a few places (e.g., "as I hopped and played in the meadow" vs. "as I frolicked and leaped across the plains"). The difference is subtle, but Translation 1 reads slightly more smoothly.
