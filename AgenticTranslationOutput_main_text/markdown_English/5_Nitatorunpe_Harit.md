谷地の魔神が自ら歌った謡「ハリツ クンナ」

ハリツ クンナ
ある日に好いお天気なので
私の谷地に眼と口とだけ
出して見ていたところが
ずっと浜の方から人の話し声がきこえて来た.
見ると,二人の若者が連れだって来た.
先に来た者は勇者らしく勇者の品を
そなえて,神の様に美しいが
後から来た者を見ると,様子の悪い
顔色の悪い男で,何か話し合いながら
やって来たが私の谷地の側を通り
ちょうど私の前へ来ると,あとから来た顔色の悪い男が
立ち止り立ち止り自分の鼻をおおい
「おお臭い,いやな谷地,悪い谷地の前を通ったら
まあ汚い,何だろうこんなに臭いのは.」
と言った.
私はただ聞いたばかりだけれど自分の居るか居ないかも
わからぬほど腹が立った.
泥の中から飛び出した.私が飛び上ると
地が裂け地が破れる.牙を
鳴らしながら,彼等を強く追っかけたところが
先に来た者は,それと見るや
魚がクルリとあとへかえる様に引っかえして顔色の悪い男の
わきの下をくぐりずーっと逃げてしまった.
青い男を二間三間追っかけると
直ぐ追いついて頭から呑んでしまった.
そこで今度は彼かの男をありったけの速力で追っかけて来て
人間の村,大きな村の後へ着いた.
見るとむこうから
火の老女,神の老女があかい着物,六枚の着物に
帯をしめ,六枚の着物を羽織って
あかい杖をついて私の側へ飛んで来た.
「これはこれは,お前は何しにこのアイヌ村へ
来るのか,さあお帰り,さあお帰り.」
言いながら,あかい杖,かねの杖をふり上げて私を
たたくと,杖から焔が
私の上へ雨の様に降って来る.
けれども私はちっとも構わず,
牙打ち鳴らしながら彼の男を
追っかけると,彼の男は村の中を
よくまわる環の様に走って行く.そのあとを飛んで
行くと,大地が裂け大地が破れる.村中は大さわぎ
妻の手を引く者,子の手を引く者,泣き叫び
逃げゆくもの,煮えくりかえるようなありさま,けれども
私は少しも構わず,土吹雪
をたてる,火の老女神は私の側を走って来ると
大へんな焔が,私の上に飛び交う.
その中に,彼の男は一軒の家に
飛び込むと直ぐにまた飛び出した.
見ると,蓬の小弓に蓬の小矢をつがえて
むこうから,ニコニコして,私をねらっている.
それを見て私は可笑しく思った.
「あんな小さな蓬の矢,何で人が苦しむものか.」と
思いながら私は牙を打ち鳴らして,
頭から呑もうとしたら
その時彼の男は私の首ッ玉を
したたかに射た.それっきりどうしたか
わからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たところが
大きな竜の耳と耳の間に私はいた.
村の人々が集って,彼かの私が追っかけた若者が
大声で指図さしずをして,私の屍体をみんな細かに刻み
一つ所へ運んで焼いてその灰を
山の岩の岩の後へ捨ててしまった.
今になってはじめて見ると,それは,ただの人間
ただの若者だと思ったのは
オキキリムイ,神の勇者であった.
恐しい悪い神,悪魔神,私はそれであって
人間の村の近くにいるので,
オキキリムイは村の為を思って,私をおこらせ
自分を追いかけさせて,蓬の矢で私を殺したので
あった.それから,先に私が呑んでしまった
青い男は,人間だと思ったのだったが
それは,オキキリムイがその放糞を人に作り,
それを連れて来たのであった.
私は魔神であったから今はもう
地獄のおそろしい悪い国にやられたのだから
これからは,人間の国には,なんの危険も
ない,邪魔ものもないであろう.
私は恐しい魔神であったけれども,
一人の人間の計略にまけて
今はもう,つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
と谷地の魔神が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Haritsu Kunna

One day, as the weather was fair,
I peeked out from my mire,
Only my eyes and mouth visible.
From the direction of the shore,
I heard the voices of men.
Looking, I saw two young men approaching side by side.

The first seemed a hero,
bearing the marks of courage,
as beautiful as a god.
But the one behind him looked ill,
a man of poor complexion.
They came discussing something,
passing by my mire.
Just as they reached before me,
the pale-faced man stopped,
covering his nose.

"Oh, the stench! A foul mire! Passing by this wretched place,
what filth! What could smell so awful?"
he exclaimed.
I merely heard his words,
yet rage swelled within me,
so much that I forgot myself.
I burst from the mud,
and as I leaped, the earth split and cracked.
Gnashing my teeth, I pursued them fiercely.

The first, seeing this,
turned back swiftly, like a fish darting around,
slipped under the pale man's arm,
and fled far away.
I chased the blue-faced man for a few steps,
quickly overtaking him,
and swallowed him whole.

Then, with all my speed, I pursued the other,
reaching a human village,
a large settlement.
From the other side,
a fire old woman, a goddess old woman,
in red robes, six layers of them,
belted and draped,
leaning on a red staff,
flew towards me.

"Well now, what brings you to this Ainu village?
Be gone! Be gone!"
she cried,
raising her red staff, her metal staff,
and struck me.
Flames rained down upon me from the staff.

Yet I paid no heed,
gnashing my teeth as I chased the man.
He ran through the village like a wheel turning,
and I flew after him,
the earth splitting and cracking.
The village was in uproar,
some pulling their wives' hands,
some pulling their children's hands,
crying out and fleeing,
a scene of utter chaos.

But I cared not,
raising a storm of dust.
The fire goddess ran beside me,
and great flames danced above me.
Amidst this, the man darted into a house,
only to emerge again.
I saw him nocking a small arrow of yomogi to a yomogi bow,
smiling as he aimed at me.

Seeing this, I found it amusing.
"How could anyone suffer from such a tiny yomogi arrow?"
I thought,
and as I gnashed my teeth,
preparing to swallow him whole,
he struck my neck with the arrow.
After that, I knew no more.

When I awoke,
I was between the ears of a great dragon.
The villagers gathered,
and the young man I had chased,
gave loud instructions.
They meticulously carved my corpse,
carried the pieces to one place,
burned them, and scattered the ashes
behind a mountain rock.

Only now do I realize that the one I thought
was merely a human,
a simple youth,
was Okikirmui, a divine hero.
A terrible, evil god, a demon god was I,
and because I was near the human village,
Okikirmui angered me for the sake of the village,
made me chase him, and killed me with a yomogi arrow.

Furthermore, the blue-faced man I swallowed,
whom I thought was human,
was a being Okikirmui created from his own excrement,
and brought with him.
Because I was a mire devil,
I have now been cast into the terrible, evil land of hell.
From now on, there will be no danger,
no disturbance in the land of humans.

Though I was a fearsome mire devil,
I was defeated by the scheme of a single human,
and now I meet a meaningless, wretched end."

So spoke the mire devil.

Harits Kunna

On a clear day,
I revealed only my eyes and mouth,
Peering out from my marsh.

From afar, the clamor of human voices reached me from the shore.
I looked and saw two young men approaching together.

The one in front,
With a noble air, seemed a hero,
Possessing a divine and handsome face.

While the one following behind,
Was gaunt and pale, his complexion poor.

They walked and spoke in hushed tones,
Passing by the edge of my marsh,
Coming right before me.

The pale-faced man stopped,
Covering his nose,

"Ah, how foul! This repulsive marsh,
Passing through this filthy place,
What is it that reeks so horribly?" he complained.

I heard him, and rage consumed me,
Almost forgetting my own existence.

I leaped from the mire with a sudden burst,
The earth cracking and shattering around me.

I roared, baring my fangs,
And charged fiercely after them.

The hero in front, seeing this,
Turned with the swiftness of a fish,
Darted under the arm of the pale-faced man,
And fled without looking back.

I pursued the sickly man for a few steps,
Quickly overtook him, and swallowed him whole.

Then, with all haste,
I chased after the hero who had fled,
Reaching a human settlement, a great village.

In the distance,
A flame old woman, a sacred crone,
Wore six layers of red robes, cinched at the waist,
Holding a red staff, and rushed towards me.

"Hey! Hey! Why have you come to this Ainu village?
Go back! Go back!" she cried sternly.

She waved her red staff, a metal staff,
Igniting flames upon it,
And showered them down upon me like rain.

But I paid no heed,
Only roared, baring my fangs,
Continuing to chase the fleeing man.

The man darted through the village,
Like a spinning wheel.

I followed close behind, rushing forth,
The earth cracking and shattering once more,
Plunging the entire village into panic.

Some pulled their wives by the hand, others their children,
Crying out, scattering in all directions,
A scene of chaos and turmoil.

But I remained unmoved,
Raising clouds of dust.

The flame old goddess ran beside me,
Vast flames weaving and dancing around me.

In the midst of the chaos, the man dashed into a house,
And immediately ran out again.

He held a small artemisia bow,
Nocked with an artemisia arrow,
A smile on his face, aiming at me.

Seeing this, I found it laughable.

"Such a tiny artemisia arrow,
How could it possibly harm anyone?" I thought.

I roared, baring my fangs,
About to swallow him whole,

When, at that moment, the man fiercely,
Shot me in the neck.

I instantly lost consciousness,
Unaware of what had happened.

When I regained awareness,
I found myself between the ears of a giant dragon.

The villagers gathered,
The young man I had chased,
Commanded loudly,
Chopping my corpse into pieces,
Carrying them to a place of burning,
And discarding the ashes behind the mountain rocks.

Only now did I understand,
The ordinary humans, the ordinary young men I thought they were,
Were actually Okikirmui, sacred heroes.

I am a terrible evil god, a demon god,
Because I approached the human village,
Okikirmui, to protect the village,
Deliberately provoked me, made me chase him,
And then killed me with an artemisia arrow.

And also, the pale-faced man I swallowed,
The human I thought he was,
Was actually created by Okikirmui from feces,
He brought that false man to lure me.

I, as a demon god, now have been,
Cast into the terrible evil realm of hell,
From now on, the human realm,
Will no longer be in any danger,
Nor will there be any obstacles.

Though I am a terrible demon god,
I was defeated by a human scheme,
And now can only die in an insignificant, miserable way.

The marsh demon thus told his story.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.8 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Generally accurate, but some phrasing is a bit clunky. The use of 'mire' is consistent with the original context. Some lines are a bit too literal, hindering the poetic flow.

#### Translation 2
Maintains a slightly better flow and tone. The word choices are generally more evocative. The translation of certain phrases, like the description of the old woman, is more vivid.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is slightly better because it maintains a more consistent tone and flow, which is important for a chant. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 2 uses slightly more evocative language and avoids some of the slightly awkward phrasing present in Translation 1. The weighted score also reflects this preference.
