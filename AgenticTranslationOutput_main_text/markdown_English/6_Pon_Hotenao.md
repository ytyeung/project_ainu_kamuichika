You have 2 versions of English translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the Translations.
2. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the accuracy of original meaning with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "Nonsense/No meaning preserved",
two stars mean "Some meaning preserved, but not understandable",
three stars mean "Some meaning preserved and understandable",
four stars mean "Most meaning preserved with possibly few grammar mistakes",
and five stars mean "Perfect meaning and grammar".

3. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the easiness to understanding with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "The text is completely not understandable.",
two stars mean "Most part of text is not understandable.",
three stars mean "While the text is understandable, the word usage and grammar are difficult.",
four stars mean "Most part of text can be understood easily.",
and five stars mean "All part of text can be understood easily.".

4. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the poetic flow with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "All the text is literal and plain.",
two stars mean "Most part of text is literal.",
three stars mean "While the text flow is smooth, some part of the text is still literal and does not sound poetic.",
four stars mean "Most part of text is poetic.",
and five stars mean "All part of the text is a poet and rhythmic. It is a chant.".

5. Choose a better translation according to the weighted score. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion (50%). Easiness to understanding is the second (30%). Poetic flow is the third (20%).
6. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

小狼の神が自ら歌った謡
「ホテナオ」

ホテナオ
ある日に退屈なので浜辺へ出て,
遊んでいたら一人の小男が
来ていたから,川下へ下ると
私も川下へ下り,
川上へ来ると私も川上へ行き道をさえぎった.
すると川下へ六回
川上へ六回になった時小男は
持前の癇癪かんしゃくを顔に表して言うことには,
「ピイピイ
この小僧め悪い小僧め,そんな事をするなら
この岬の,昔の名と今の名を
言い解いて見ろ」
私は聞いて笑いながらいうこと
には,
「誰がこの岬の昔の名と
今の名を知らないものか!
昔は,尊いえらい神様や人間が居ったから
この岬を神の岬と
言ったものだが,今は時代が衰えたから
御幣の岬とよんでいるのさ!」
云うと,小男の云うことには,
「ピイトン,ピイトン
この小僧め本当にお前はそういうなら
この川の前の名と今の名を
云って見ろ.」
聞くと,私の云うことには,
「誰がこの川の前の名
今の名を知らないものか!
昔,えらかった時代にはこの川を
流れの早い川と云っていたのだが
今は世が衰えているので流れの遅い川と
云っているのさ.」
云うと小男の云うことには,
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン
本当にお前そんな事を云うなら
お互の素性の解き合いをやろう.」
聞いて私の云うことには,
「誰がお前の素性を知らないものか!
大昔,オキキリムイが山へ行って
狩猟小舎を建てた時榛はしばみの木の炉縁ろぶちを作ったら
その炉縁が火に当ってからからに乾いてしまった.
オキキリムイが片方を踏むと片一方が
上る,それをオキキリムイが怒って
その炉縁を川へ持って下り
捨ててしまったのだ.
それからその炉縁は流れに沿うて流れていって
海へ出で,彼方かなたの海波,此方こなたの海波
に打ちつけられる様を神様たちが御覧になって,
敬うべきえらいオキキリムイの手作りの物がその様に
何の役にもたたず迷い流れて海水と共に腐ってしまうのは
勿体もったいない事だから神様たちから
その炉縁は魚にされて,
炉縁魚と
名づけられたのだ.
ところがその炉縁魚は,自分の素性が
わからないので,人にばけてうろついている.
その炉縁魚がお前なのさ.」
云うと,小男は顔色を
変え変え聞いていたが
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン!
お前は,小さい,狼の子なの
さ.」
云い終ると直ぐに海へパチャンと飛び込んだ.
あと見送ると一つの赤い魚が
尾鰭おびれを動かしてずーっと沖へ
行ってしまった.
と,幼い狼の神様が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Hotenao.
One day, feeling bored, I went down to the beach to play.
A little man came along.
When I went downstream, he also went downstream.
When I went upstream, he also went upstream, blocking my path.
This happened six times downstream and six times upstream.
The little man, his temper flaring, showed it on his face and said,
"Pii-pii!
You little brat, you bad little brat! If you're going to act like that,
tell me the old name and the current name of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, said,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this cape?
In the old days, because there were revered and great gods and people,
this cape was called God's Cape.
But now, because the times have declined,
it is called Nusa Cape!"
Upon hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you really know so much,
tell me the old name and the current name of this river!"
Listening to him, I said,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name of this river?
In the old, great times, this river was called
The River with the Swift Current,
but now that the world has declined, it is called
The River with the Slow Current."
Upon hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you really know so much, let's test each other's origins."
Listening to him, I said,
"Who doesn't know your origin?
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
and built a hunting lodge, he made a *hasibami* (hazel) wood *robuchi* (fire surround).
When the *robuchi* was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side would rise up.
Okikirmui, angered by this,
took the *robuchi* down to the river
and threw it away.
Then, the *robuchi* floated along the current
out to the sea, and the gods watched
as it was tossed about by the waves far and near.
The gods thought,
'It is a waste that something made by the revered and great Okikirmui
is drifting aimlessly and rotting with the seawater, serving no purpose.'
So the gods transformed
the *robuchi* into a fish,
and it was named *Robuchi* Fish.
However, the *Robuchi* Fish, not knowing its own origin,
disguises itself as a person and wanders about.
That *Robuchi* Fish is you!"
The little man listened, his face changing color.
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You are a small wolf child!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
Looking after him, I saw a single red fish
moving its tail fins and going far out to sea.
So, the young wolf god told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
One day, overcome by boredom, I wandered to the sea.
As I played, a little dwarf appeared before me.
I went down the river, and he followed me downstream;
I went up the river, and he followed me upstream, blocking my path.

After going back and forth six times downstream, and six times upstream,
the little dwarf, unable to contain himself any longer, said with a face full of anger:
"Pii pii!
You little brat, you are truly a bad kid!
If you really have the ability, then speak the ancient and current names of this cape!"

I listened and replied with a smile:
"Who wouldn't know the ancient and current names of this cape?
In the past, because noble and great gods and humans lived here,
this cape was called the Cape of the Gods.
Now, as the times decline, it is called the Cape of Sacred Wands!"

The little dwarf listened and said:
"Pii ton, pii ton!
You little brat, if you really have the ability,
speak the old and current names of this river!"

I listened and said:
"Who wouldn't know the old and current names of this river?
In that great era of the past, this river was called the River of Swift Currents.
Now, as the world declines, it is called the River of Slow Currents!"

The little dwarf listened and shouted:
"Pii ton ton, pii ton ton!
If you really have the ability, why don't we reveal each other's secrets!"

I listened and replied:
"Who wouldn't know your secrets?
Long ago, Okikirmui went to the mountains,
and when building a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame from hazel wood.
That hearth frame was baked by the fire until it was dry and brittle.
When Okikirmui stepped on one end of the hearth frame, the other end lifted up.
In anger, Okikirmui threw that hearth frame into the river.

From then on, that hearth frame drifted down the river, eventually flowing into the sea.
The gods saw it being struck by the distant waves and the nearby waves,
and thought it a pity that something made by the beloved Okikirmui himself
should end up in such a state, drifting uselessly and eventually decaying with the seawater.
So, the gods transformed that hearth frame into a fish,
and called it the Hearth Frame Fish.

However, that Hearth Frame Fish did not know its own origins,
so it transformed into a human and wandered around.
You, are that Hearth Frame Fish!"

The little dwarf listened, his face changing colors repeatedly,
"Pii ton ton, pii ton ton!
You, are just a small, wolf's child!"

Before his voice faded, he immediately jumped into the sea with a "splash".
I watched him go, and saw a red fish,
swimming straight into the distance, wagging its tail fin.

-- Thus spoke the young wolf god.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.1 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation is straightforward and easy to understand. It accurately conveys the plot and dialogue. However, it could benefit from more evocative language to capture the tone of a traditional Ainu chant.

#### Translation 2
This translation uses slightly more descriptive language and maintains a consistent tone. The phrases like 'wandered to the sea' and 'unable to contain himself any longer' add more color. The use of 'dwarf' instead of 'little man' is a stylistic choice that adds to the story-telling feel.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is slightly better because it uses more vivid language and maintains a more consistent tone, which is important for conveying the story-telling aspect of the chant. For example, phrases like 'wandered to the sea' and 'unable to contain himself any longer' add more color than the plainer language in Translation 1. However, both translations are quite good and capture the essence of the original Japanese text.
