2. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the accuracy of original meaning with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "Nonsense/No meaning preserved",
two stars mean "Some meaning preserved, but not understandable",
three stars mean "Some meaning preserved and understandable",
four stars mean "Most meaning preserved with possibly few grammar mistakes",
and five stars mean "Perfect meaning and grammar".

5. Choose a better translation according to the weighted score. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion (50%). Easiness to understanding is the second (30%). Poetic flow is the third (20%).
6. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original meaning accurately.
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.

獺かわうそが自ら歌った謡
「カッパ レウレウ カッパ」

カッパ レウレウ カッパ
ある日に,流れに沿うて遊びながら
泳いで下りサマユンクルの
水汲路のところに来ると,
サマユンクルの妹が神の様な美しい容子で
片手に手桶を持ち片手に
蒲の束を持って来ているので
川の縁に私は頭だけ出し,
「お父様をお持ちですか?
お母様をお持ちですか?」と云うと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見つけると,怒の色を顔に
現して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと,大きな犬どもが
駈け出して来て,私を見ると牙を鳴ら
している.私はビックリして川の底へ
潜り込んで直ぐそのまま川底を通って
逃げ下った.
そうして,オキキリムイの水汲路の
川口へ頭だけだして
見ると,オキキリムイの妹が
神の様に美しい様子で片手に手桶を持ち
片手に蒲の束を持って
来たので私のいうことには,
「御父様をお持ちですか?
御母様をお持ちですか?」というと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見ると,怒りの色を顔に
表して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと大きな犬どもが駈け出して来た.
それを見て私は先刻の事を思い出し
可笑しく思いながら川の底へ
潜りこんで逃げようとしたら,
まさか犬たちがそんな事をしようとは
思わなかったのに,牙を鳴らしながら
川の底まで私に飛び付き
陸へ私を引き摺り上げ,私の頭も私の体も
噛みつかれ噛みむしられて,しまいに
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気が付いて見ると,
大きな獺の耳と耳の間に私はすわって
いた.
サマユンクルもオキキリムイも
父もなく母もないのを私は知って
あんな悪戯をしたので罰を当てられ
オキキリムイの犬どもに殺され
つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
これからの獺たちよ,決して悪戯をしなさるな.
と,獺が物語った.

This is the English Translation 1.
“Kappa reureu kappa”

Kappa reureu kappa,
One day, as I played along the stream,
Swimming down, I came to Samayunkuru's
Water-drawing place.
Samayunkuru's younger sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Carried a pail in one hand and
A bundle of reeds in the other.
I poked my head out at the river's edge and asked,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden, startled, darted her eyes around,
And finding me, a look of anger crossed her face.
"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!"
At her call, large dogs came rushing out,
Baring their fangs at me. Startled, I dove to the river bottom,
And fled downstream along the riverbed.

Then, at Okikirmui's water-drawing place,
I poked my head out again,
Okikirmui's younger sister,
Beautiful as a goddess, carried a pail in one hand
A bundle of reeds in the other.
So I said,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden, startled, darted her eyes around,
And finding me, a look of anger crossed her face,
"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!"
At her call, large dogs came rushing out.
Remembering what happened before, I found it funny,
And as I dove to the river bottom to escape,
Though I never expected the dogs to do such a thing,
They leaped into the river after me, teeth bared,
Hauled me ashore, and bit and tore at my head and body,
Until I lost all sense of what was happening.

When I came to, I found myself
Sitting between the ears of a large otter.
I knew that neither Samayunkuru nor Okikirmui
Had father or mother, and I played that prank,
So I was punished, killed by Okikirmui's dogs,
And met a meaningless, wretched death.
Otters of the future, never play such pranks.
So, the otter told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
"Kapa reureu kapa,"

Kapa reureu kapa,

One day, as I frolicked down the river,
I swam to the watering place of Samayunkuru.

There I saw the sister of Samayunkuru,
Beautiful as a goddess,
With a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.

I peeked my head above the water and asked:
"Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden was startled,
Her eyes widened as she looked around,
Spotting me, her face filled with rage.

"Ah, hateful flathead, detestable flathead,
Daring to mock me! Dogs, get him!"

Before she finished speaking, several large dogs rushed out,
Snarling and baring their teeth at me.
Startled, I immediately dove to the river bottom,
Fleeing along the riverbed.

Later, I poked my head out again,
At the mouth of the watering place of Okikirmui.

There I saw the sister of Okikirmui,
Also beautiful as a goddess,
With a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.

So I asked:
"Do you have a father? Do you have a mother?"

The maiden was startled as well,
Her eyes widened as she looked around,
Finding me, anger surfaced on her face.

"Ah, hateful flathead, detestable flathead,
Daring to mock me! Dogs, get him!"

The large dogs immediately rushed out.

Seeing this, I recalled my previous encounter,
Found it amusing, and was about to dive to the river bottom to escape,

But I never expected those dogs to do such a thing,
They plunged into the river, snarling and snapping,
Dragging me ashore, my head and body,
Were torn and devoured, and finally, I lost consciousness.

When I awoke, I found myself,
Sitting between the ears of a large otter.

Samayunkuru and Okikirmui,
I knew they had no parents,
Yet I still played a prank, and thus I was punished,
Killed by the dogs of Okikirmui,
Meeting such a pointless, pathetic end.

Future otters, never play such pranks again.

So spoke the otter.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.1 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is a solid translation that accurately conveys the meaning of the original Japanese text. It is easy to understand and maintains a consistent tone. However, it could benefit from more vivid language and a slightly more poetic flow.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is a slightly more vivid and engaging translation. It uses stronger language and maintains a consistent tone. However, it could benefit from a slightly more polished feel.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is slightly better because it uses more vivid language and maintains a more consistent tone. For example, "frolicked down the river" is more evocative than "played along the stream." The phrase "Daring to mock me!" captures the anger more effectively than "Making fun of people!" However, both translations are quite good and capture the essence of the original Japanese text.
