獺かわうそが自ら歌った謡
「カッパ レウレウ カッパ」

カッパ レウレウ カッパ
ある日に,流れに沿うて遊びながら
泳いで下りサマユンクルの
水汲路のところに来ると,
サマユンクルの妹が神の様な美しい容子で
片手に手桶を持ち片手に
蒲の束を持って来ているので
川の縁に私は頭だけ出し,
「お父様をお持ちですか?
お母様をお持ちですか?」と云うと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見つけると,怒の色を顔に
現して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと,大きな犬どもが
駈け出して来て,私を見ると牙を鳴ら
している.私はビックリして川の底へ
潜り込んで直ぐそのまま川底を通って
逃げ下った.
そうして,オキキリムイの水汲路の
川口へ頭だけだして
見ると,オキキリムイの妹が
神の様に美しい様子で片手に手桶を持ち
片手に蒲の束を持って
来たので私のいうことには,
「御父様をお持ちですか?
御母様をお持ちですか?」というと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見ると,怒りの色を顔に
表して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと大きな犬どもが駈け出して来た.
それを見て私は先刻の事を思い出し
可笑しく思いながら川の底へ
潜りこんで逃げようとしたら,
まさか犬たちがそんな事をしようとは
思わなかったのに,牙を鳴らしながら
川の底まで私に飛び付き
陸へ私を引き摺り上げ,私の頭も私の体も
噛みつかれ噛みむしられて,しまいに
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気が付いて見ると,
大きな獺の耳と耳の間に私はすわって
いた.
サマユンクルもオキキリムイも
父もなく母もないのを私は知って
あんな悪戯をしたので罰を当てられ
オキキリムイの犬どもに殺され
つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
これからの獺たちよ,決して悪戯をしなさるな.
と,獺が物語った.

“Kappa reureu kappa”

Kappa reureu kappa,
One day, as I played along the stream,
Swimming down, I came to Samayunkuru's
Water-drawing place.
Samayunkuru's sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Carrying a pail in one hand and
A bundle of reeds in the other, was there.
I poked my head out at the river's edge and asked,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden, startled, looked around,
And finding me, her face filled with anger,
"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!"
At her call, large dogs rushed out,
Baring their fangs at me. Startled, I dove
To the river bottom and fled downstream.

Then, at the mouth of Okikirmui's water-drawing place,
I poked my head out again.
Okikirmui's sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Carrying a pail in one hand and
A bundle of reeds in the other, was there.
I said to her,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden, startled, looked around,
And finding me, her face filled with anger,
"Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!"
At her call, large dogs rushed out.
Remembering what happened before, and finding it funny,
I tried to dive to the river bottom to escape,
But never would I have thought the dogs would do such a thing,
Snapping their fangs, they leaped into the river after me,
Hauled me ashore, bit and tore at my head and body,
Until I lost all sense of what was happening.

When I came to, I was sitting
Between the ears of a large otter.
I knew that Samayunkuru and Okikirmui
Had neither father nor mother, and I played
Such pranks because of that. I was punished,
Killed by Okikirmui's dogs,
A meaningless, wicked death.
From now on, you otters, never play such pranks.
So, the otter told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
KAPPA REUREU KAPPA

One day, I was frolicking down the stream,
When I swam to the water-drawing place of Samaunkuru.
The sister of Samaunkuru, beautiful as a goddess,
Held a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.
I only showed my head by the river and asked:
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden was startled, her eyes flustered.
When she found me, her face filled with anger,
"Ah, hateful flathead, wicked flathead,
Daring to fool people. Dogs, go!"
Before she finished speaking, several large dogs rushed out,
Snarling at me. I was startled,
Quickly dived to the bottom of the river and fled along the riverbed.

Then, I was at the water-drawing place of Okikirimui,
Only showing my head.
The sister of Okikirimui, also with the beauty of a goddess,
Held a bucket in one hand and a cattail in the other.
So I asked:
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The maiden panicked, looking around,
After finding me, her face was full of anger,
"Ah, hateful flathead, wicked flathead,
Daring to fool people. Dogs, go!"
Before she finished speaking, the big dogs swarmed up.

Seeing this, I remembered what had just happened,
I found it funny, and was about to dive into the river to escape,
But I never expected the dogs to do that.
They chased me all the way to the bottom of the river, barking at me,
Dragging me ashore, my head and body,
Were bitten and torn by them, and in the end I didn't know what happened.

Suddenly, I came back to my senses,
I found myself sitting between the ears of a huge otter.

I knew that both Samaunkuru and Okikirimui
Had no parents, but I deliberately teased them,
That's why I was punished, bitten to death by Okikirimui's dogs,
Ending up in such a boring and sad end.

Future otters, never play pranks again.

The otter tells the story.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4.5 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4.1 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is generally well-written and maintains a good flow. It captures the essence of the story and is easy to understand. The repetition is also well-handled.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is accurate but feels a bit more literal and less poetic. Some of the phrasing is slightly awkward, making it a bit less engaging to read.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 maintains a slightly better poetic flow and rhythm, which is important for a chant. While both translations are accurate, Translation 1's phrasing is generally more evocative and easier to read. The weighted score also reflects this preference, prioritizing accuracy but also considering readability and poetic quality.
