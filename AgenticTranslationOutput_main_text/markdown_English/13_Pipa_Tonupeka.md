1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the Translations.
2. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the accuracy of original meaning with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "Nonsense/No meaning preserved",
two stars mean "Some meaning preserved, but not understandable",
three stars mean "Some meaning preserved and understandable",
four stars mean "Most meaning preserved with possibly few grammar mistakes",
and five stars mean "Perfect meaning and grammar".

3. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the easiness to understanding with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "The text is completely not understandable.",
two stars mean "Most part of text is not understandable.",
three stars mean "While the text is understandable, the word usage and grammar are difficult.",
four stars mean "Most part of text can be understood easily.",
and five stars mean "All part of text can be understood easily.".

4. For each of translation from Japanese to English, score the translation on the poetic flow with one to five stars [1,2,3,4,5].
Where one star means "All the text is literal and plain.",
two stars mean "Most part of text is literal.",
three stars mean "While the text flow is smooth, some part of the text is still literal and does not sound poetic.",
four stars mean "Most part of text is poetic.",
and five stars mean "All part of the text is a poet and rhythmic. It is a chant.".

5. Choose a better translation according to the weighted score. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion (50%). Easiness to understanding is the second (30%). Poetic flow is the third (20%).
6. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original meaning accurately.
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.

This is the Japanese text.
沼貝が自ら歌った謡「トヌペカ ランラン」

トヌペカ ランラン
強烈な日光に私の居る所も
乾いてしまって今にも私は死にそうです.
「誰か,水を飲ませて下すって
助けて下さればいい.水よ水よ」と私たちが泣き叫んで
いますと,ずーっと浜の方から一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.
私たちは泣いていますと,私たちの傍を通り
私たちを見ると,
「おかしな沼貝,悪い沼貝,何を泣いて
うるさい事さわいでいるのだろう.」と言って
私たちを踏みつけ,足先にかけ飛ばし,貝殻と共につぶして
ずーっと山へ行ってしまいました.
「おお痛,苦しい,水よ水よ.」と泣き叫んで
いると,ずっと浜の方からまた一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.私たちは
「誰か私たちに水を飲ませて助けて下さるといい,
おお痛,おお苦しい,水よ水よ.」と叫び泣きました
すると,娘さんは,神の様な美しい気高い様子で
私の側へ来て私たちを見ると,
「まあかわいそうに,大へん暑くて沼貝たちの
寝床も乾いてしまって水を欲しがって
いるのだね,どうしたのでしょう
何だか踏みつけられでもした様だが......」と言いつつ
私たちみんなを拾い集めて蕗の葉に
入れて,きれいな湖に入れてくれました.
清い冷水でスッカリ元気を恢復し
大へん丈夫になりました.そこで始めて
かの女たちの気性を探って
見ると,先に来て,私を踏みつぶした
にくらしい女,わるい女はサマユンクルの
妹で,私たちを憫み
助けて下さった若い娘さん淑しとやかな方
は,オキキリムイの妹なのでありました.
サマユンクルの妹は悪にくらしいので
その粟畑を枯らしてしまい,オキキリムイの
妹のその粟畑をばよく実らせました.
その年に,オキキリムイの妹は大そう多く収穫をしました.
私の故為せいでそうなった事を知って
沼貝の殻で粟の穂を摘みました.
それから,毎年,人間の女たちは
栗の穂を摘む時は沼貝の殻を使う様になったのです.
と,一つの沼貝が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Tonupeka Ranran,
Under the fierce sun, my home dries,
And I, near death, cry out.
"Oh, someone, grant us water,
Save us, we beg! Water, water!" we cried,
When from the shore, a woman came,
A basket upon her back.
We wept, but she passed us by,
And seeing us, she scoffed,
"Foolish clams, wretched clams, why do you cry,
Making such a noisy fuss?"
She trampled us, kicked us aside,
Crushing shells beneath her feet,
And went away into the mountains.
"Oh, the pain, the suffering, water, water!" we cried,
When from the shore, another woman came,
A basket upon her back. We cried,
"Oh, someone, grant us water and save us!
Oh, the pain, oh, the suffering, water, water!"
Then, like a goddess, with noble grace,
She came to us and seeing us, she said,
"Oh, you poor things, so hot and dry,
The clams' beds parched, longing for water.
What has happened here?
It seems you have been trampled..."
And gathering us all, she placed us gently
Upon a fuki leaf, and carried us
To a clear lake.
In the pure, cool water, we revived,
Our strength restored. Then we learned
The nature of these women.
The first, who crushed us,
That hateful, wicked woman, was the sister of Samayunkuru.
But the kind young maiden,
Who pitied us and saved us,
Was the sister of Okikirmui.
The sister of Samayunkuru, being cruel and wicked,
Caused her millet fields to wither,
But the sister of Okikirmui
Made her millet fields flourish.
That year, the sister of Okikirmui harvested a great bounty.
Knowing it was because of me,
She used clam shells to harvest the millet.
And from that day on, each year, human women
Have used clam shells when harvesting millet.
Thus, a single clam told its tale.

This is the English Translation 2.
The clam himself sings this song: "Tonupka Ranran"

Tonupka Ranran
Under the fierce sun, my home bakes,
Cracked and dry, I gasp for life.
"Who will have mercy, grant us sweet rain,
Save us from this parched fate? Water, water!" we cry in despair.

Then, from the distant shore, a woman appears,
Carrying a bamboo basket, her steps hurried.
We cry out to her, but she passes us by,
Glancing down, she sneers with cruel words:
"Loathsome clams, wretched clams,
Why do you wail and clamor, disturbing the peace!"

With that, she stomps and kicks,
Crushing us and our shells to dust.
She strides away, heading deep into the mountains.
"Pain, agony, water, water!" we wail in vain.

Soon after, another woman approaches from the shore,
Also carrying a bamboo basket. We plead:
"Oh, that someone might grant us clear water, save us from this plight.
Pain, agony, water, water!"

This woman, beautiful and noble as a goddess,
Comes to our side, sees our plight, and sighs with pity:
"How pitiful, suffering in this heat, the clams'
home dried up, longing for rain.
What has happened here? It seems they have been trampled…"

She carefully gathers us, one by one,
Places us on fuki leaves, and gently sets us in the clear lake water.
The cool lake water revives us,
Restoring our strength, making us strong again.

And so, I began to discern their natures.
The hateful woman who came and trampled us,
Was the sister of Samayunkur.
But the young woman who pitied us and offered aid,
Was the sister of Okikirmuy.

The sister of Samayunkur harbors malice,
Causing her millet fields to wither and die.
The sister of Okikirmuy,
Causes her millet fields to flourish and abound.

That year, the sister of Okikirmuy harvested a great bounty of millet.
Learning that this was thanks to us clams,
She used clam shells to pluck the millet ears.

From that day forward, each year, the women of humankind
Use clam shells when they harvest the millet ears.

So spoke the clam.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.8 |
| Translation 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3.3 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is straightforward and clear, maintaining a consistent tone. It accurately conveys the narrative but could benefit from a slightly more poetic touch to reflect the chant-like nature of the original Ainu text.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 attempts to add a poetic flair, which is commendable, but sometimes sacrifices clarity and directness. The use of phrases like 'gasp for life' and 'parched fate' adds drama but may not be entirely faithful to the original text's tone. The shift to 'bamboo basket' from 'basket' is a good addition for cultural context.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 is slightly better because it maintains a more consistent tone and directness, which aligns well with the original Japanese text's narrative style. While Translation 2 has some poetic elements, it occasionally deviates from a straightforward recounting of the story. Translation 1's simplicity and clarity make it easier to follow the narrative, and its word choices are more precise in conveying the original meaning.
