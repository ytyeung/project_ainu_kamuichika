海の神が自ら歌った謡「アトイカ
トマトマキ クントテアシ フム フム!」

アトイカ トマトマキ クントテアシ フムフム
長い兄様,六人の兄様,長い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様,短い姉様,六人の姉様が
私を育てて居たが,私は
宝物の積んである傍に高床をしつらえ,その高床の上に
すわって鞘さや刻み鞘彫り
それのみを
事として暮していた.
毎日,朝になると兄様たちは
矢筒を背負って姉様たちと一しょに出て行って
暮方になると疲れた顔色で
何も持たずに帰って来て姉様たちは
疲れているのに食事拵こしらえをし,私にお膳を出して
自分たちも食事をして食事のあとが片附くと,
それから兄様たちは矢を作るのに忙しく手を動かす.
矢筒が一ぱいになると,みんな疲れているものだから
寝ると高鼾たかいびきを響かせてねむってしまう.
その次の日になるとまだ暗い中に
みんな起きて姉様たちが食事拵えをして私に膳を出し
みんな食事が済むと,また矢筒を背負って
行ってしまう.また夕方になると
疲れた顔色で何も持たずに帰って来て
姉様たちは食事拵え,兄様たちは矢を作って,
何時いつでも同じ事をしていた.
ある日にまた兄様たち姉様たちは
矢筒を背負って出て行ってしまった.
宝物の彫刻を私はしていたがやがて
高床の上に起き上り金の小弓に
金の小矢を持って外へ出て
見ると海はひろびろと凪なぎて
海の東へ海の西へ鯨たちが
パチャパチャと遊んで居る.すると
海の東に長い姉様,六人の姉様が手をつらねて輪をつくると,
短い姉様,六人の姉様が,輪の中へ鯨を追い込む,
長い兄様,六人の兄様,短い兄様,六人の兄様が
輪の中へ鯨をねらい射つと,その鯨の
下を矢が通り上を矢が通る.
毎日毎日彼等はこんな事をして
いたのであった.見ると海の中央に
大きな鯨が親子の鯨が上へ下へ
パチャパチャと遊んで居るのが見えたので
遠い所から金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえてねらい射ったところ,一本の矢で
一度に親子の鯨を射貫いてしまった.
そこで一つの鯨のまんなかを斬って
その半分を姉様たちの輪の中へ
ほうりこんだ.それから鯨一ツ半の鯨を
尾の下にいれて人間の国に
むかって行きオタシュツ村に
着いて一ツ半の鯨を
村の浜へ押し上げてやった.
それから海の上にゆっくりと
游いで帰って
来たところが,誰かが
息を切らしてその側をはしるものがあるので
見ると,海のごめであった.
息をきらしながら云うことには,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
勇マシイ神様,大神様,
あなたはなんの為に,卑しい人間共,悪い人間共に
大きな海幸をおやりになったのです.
卑しい人間共,悪い人間共は,斧もて
鎌をもて大きな海幸をブツブツ切ったり突っついたり
削り取っています,勇ましい神様
大神様さあ早く大海幸を
お取り返しなさいませ.あんなに沢山,海幸をおやりに
なっても卑しい人間たち悪い人間たちは
有難いとも思わずこんな事をします.」
と云うので私は笑って云う
ことには,
「私は人間たちに呉れてやったものだから
今はもう自分の物だから,人間たちが
自分の持物を鎌でつつこうが斧で
削ろうがどうでも
自分たちの自由に食べたらいいではないか
それがどうなのだ.」と云うと
海のごめは所在無げにしているけれども
私はそれを少しも構わず海の上を
ゆっくりとおよいで
もう日が暮れようとしている時に,私の海へ
着いた.見ると
十二人の兄様,十二人の
姉様は,彼の半分の鯨をはこび
きれなくてみんなで掛声高く
海の東に,グズグズしている.
私は実にあきれてしまった.
私はそれに構わずに家へ
帰り,高床の上にすわった.
そこで後ふりかえって人間の世界の方を
見ると,私が打ち上げた一ツ
半の鯨のまわりをとりまいてりっぱな男たちや
りっぱな女たちが盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば歓び躍り,後の砂丘
の上にはりっぱな敷物が敷かれて
その上にオタシュツ村の村長が
六枚の着物に帯を束たばね,六枚の着物を
羽織って,りっぱな神の冠,先祖の冠を
頭に冠り,神授の剣を腰に佩はき
神の様に美しい様子で手を高くさし上げ
礼拝をしている.人間たちは泣いて
海幸をよろこんでいる.
何をごめが人間たちが
斧で鎌で私の押し上げた鯨を
突っついていると云ったが,
村長をはじめ
村民は,昔から
宝物の最も尊いものとしている神剣を取り出して
それで肉を斬って搬はこんでいる.
それから,私の兄様たち姉様たちは帰って来る
様子もない.
二日三日たった時,窗の方に
何か見える様だ,それで
振りかえって見て見ると,窗の上に
かねの盃にあふれる程
酒がはいっていてその上に
御幣を取りつけた酒箸が載っていて,
行きつ戻りつ,使者としての口上を述べて云うには,
「私はオタシュツ村の人で
畏れ多い事ながらおみきを差し上げます.」と
オタシュツ村の村長が村民
一同を代表して私に礼をのべる
次第をくわしく話し,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
大神様,勇ましい神様でなくて誰が,
この様に私たちの村に饑饉があって
もう,どうにも仕様がない程
食物に窮している時に哀れんで下されましょう.
私たちの村に生命を与えて下さいました事,
誠に有難う御座います,海幸をよろこび
少しの酒を作りまして,小さな幣ぬさを
添え,大神様に謝礼
申し上げる次第であります.」という事を
幣つきの酒箸が行きつ戻りつ申し立てた.
それで私は起き上って,かねの盃を
取り,押しいただいて
上の座の六つの酒樽の蓋ふたを開き
美酒を少しずつ入れて
かねの盃を窗の上にのせた.
それが済むと,高床の上に腰を下し
見ると彼の盃は箸と共に
なくなっていた.それから,鞘を刻み
鞘を彫り,していてやがて
ふと面をあげて見ると,
家の中は美しい幣で一ぱいになっていて
家の中は白い雲がたなびき白いいなびかりが
ピカピカ光っている.私はああ美しいと思った.
それからまた,二日三日たつと,
その時やっと,家のそとで,兄様たちや
姉様たちが掛声高く彼の鯨を
引っ張って来たのがきこえだした.私はあきれて
しまった.家の中へはいる様子を
眺めると,兄様たちや姉様たちは
たいへん疲れて,顔色も萎しおれている.
みんなはいって来て,沢山の幣を見ると,
驚いてみんななん遍もなん遍も拝した.
そのうちに,東の座の六つの酒樽は
溢れるばかりになって,神の好物の
酒の香が家の中に漂うた.
それから私は,美しい幣で家の中を飾りつけ,
遠方の神,近所の神を招待し
盛んな酒宴を張った.姉様たちは
鯨を煮て,神たちに出すと,
神たちは,舌鼓を打ってよろこんだ.
宴酣たけなわの頃私は起き上り
斯々かくかく,人間世界に饑饉があって
あわれに思い,海幸を打ち上げた次第や
人間たちをよくしてやると,悪い神々が
それをねたみ,海のごめが私に中
傷した事や,オタシュツ村の
村長が斯々の言葉をとって私に礼をのべ
幣つきの酒箸が使者になって来た事など
詳しく物語ると,神たちは
一度に揃って打ちうなずきつつ,
私をほめたたえた.
それからまた,盛な宴をはり
神たちの,そこに
ここに舞う音,躍る音は
美しき響をなし,姉様たちは
提子ちょうしを持って席の間を酌して
まわるもあり,女神たち
と共に美しい声で歌うもある.
二日三日たって宴を閉じた.
神々に美しい幣を二つ三つずつ
上げると神々は腰の央なかを
ギックリ屈めてなん遍もなん遍も礼をして,
みんな自分の家に立ち帰った.
そのあと,何時でも同じく長い兄様,六人の兄様
長い姉様,六人の姉様,短い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様と一しょにい,
人間たちが酒を造るとその度毎に
私に酒を送り私のところへ幣をよこす.
今はもう,人間たちも食物の不足も
なんの困る事も無く平穏に
暮しているので,私は安心をしています.

This is the English Translation 1.
Atoika tomatomaki kuntoteashi hum hum!

Atoika tomatomaki kuntoteashi hum hum!
My elder brothers, six in number, my elder sisters, six in number,
My younger brothers, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
They raised me well. I,
Near the piled-up treasures, I built a raised platform, and upon it,
I sat, carving sheaths, engraving sheaths,
That alone
Was my life's work.
Each day, as morning broke, my brothers would
Shoulder their quivers and go out with my sisters,
And as evening fell, they would return with weary faces,
Empty-handed. My sisters,
Though tired, would prepare the meal, setting a tray before me,
Then eat themselves. When the dishes were cleared,
My brothers would busily craft arrows.
When the quivers were full, they would all be so tired
They would sleep, their loud snores echoing.
The next day, while it was still dark,
They would all rise, my sisters preparing the meal, setting a tray before me.
When all had eaten, they would again shoulder their quivers
And depart. Again, as evening fell,
They would return with weary faces, empty-handed.
My sisters would prepare the meal, my brothers would craft arrows,
Always the same.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters
Shouldered their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but soon
I rose from the platform, took my golden bow
And golden arrows, and went outside.
The sea was wide and calm,
And whales were playing, splashing,
To the east and west of the sea. Then,
To the east of the sea, my elder sisters, six in number, joined hands and made a ring,
My younger sisters, six in number, drove the whales into the ring,
My elder brothers, six in number, my younger brothers, six in number,
Aimed and shot at the whales within the ring, their arrows
Passing beneath and above the whales.
Every day they did this.
Then, in the center of the sea,
A great whale and its calf were playing,
Splashing up and down. So,
From afar, I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow,
Aimed, and shot, piercing both whale and calf
With a single arrow.
Then, I cut one whale in half,
Hurling half into my sisters' ring.
Then, with one and a half whales,
I went towards the land of humans,
Arriving at Otasutsu village,
And pushed the one and a half whales
Onto the village beach.
Then, I swam slowly back
Across the sea,
When someone came running, breathless,
It was the sea-gome.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tominkarukuru kamuykarukuru isoyankerukuru!
Brave god, great god,
Why have you given such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, with axes
And sickles, are cutting, poking,
And scraping away at the great sea bounty. Brave god,
great god, quickly
Take back the great sea bounty! Even though you give them so much,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not appreciate it and do such things!"
So I laughed and said,
"I gave it to the humans,
It is theirs now, so let them
Poke at it with sickles, or scrape at it with axes,
Let them eat it as they please,
What does it matter?" Then
The sea-gome looked lost,
But I paid it no mind and swam slowly
Across the sea,
And as the day was ending, I arrived at my sea.
There,
My twelve brothers, my twelve
Sisters, could not carry
The half whale, and were all struggling,
Making a ruckus to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.
I paid them no mind and went home,
Sitting on the raised platform.
Then, looking back towards the human world,
Around the one and a half
Whales I had beached, fine men and
Fine women were dressed in finery,
Rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty, and on the dunes behind,
A fine mat was spread,
And upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,
With six robes and bundled sashes, wearing six robes,
And wearing a fine god's crown, an ancestral crown,
Upon his head, and a god-given sword at his waist,
Looking as beautiful as a god, raised his hands high
And worshipped. The humans were crying,
Rejoicing over the sea bounty.
What the gome said, that the humans were
Poking at the whale I had beached
With axes and sickles,
Was not true. The village chief and
The villagers were taking out
The god sword, which they had always
Treasured most, and using it
To cut the meat and carry it away.
Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something
Appeared in the window. So,
I turned and looked, and in the window
Was a golden cup, overflowing
With sake, and upon it
Were sake chopsticks adorned with gohei,
Going back and forth, delivering a message as an envoy,
saying,
"I am from Otasutsu village,
And with great reverence, I offer you sake." And
The village chief of Otasutsu village,
Representing all the villagers,
Spoke in detail of his gratitude,
saying,
"Tominkarukuru kamuykarukuru isoyankerukuru!
Great god, brave god, who else
Would have pity on our village, which was suffering a famine
And was so desperately
Lacking food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing over the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake,
Added a small nusa,
And offer our thanks
To the great god." This
Was what the gohei-adorned sake chopsticks
Repeated back and forth.
So I rose, took the golden cup,
And reverently received it,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels
On the upper seat,
Poured a little fine sake into each,
And placed the golden cup in the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the platform
And saw that the cup and chopsticks
Were gone. Then, I carved sheaths
And engraved sheaths, and soon
I looked up,
And the house was full of beautiful gohei,
And white clouds were drifting through the house, and white lightning
Was flashing. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful!"
Then, again, two or three days passed,
And at that time, finally, outside the house,
I heard my brothers and
Sisters pulling the whale,
Shouting loudly. I was amazed.
I watched them enter the house,
And my brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces
Withered. When they all came in and saw the many gohei,
They were surprised and worshipped many times.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels on the east seat
Were overflowing, and the scent of the god's favorite
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful gohei,
Invited distant gods and nearby gods,
And held a grand feast. My sisters
Boiled the whale and offered it to the gods,
And the gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
As the feast reached its height, I rose
And told in detail how there was a famine in the human world
And I pitied them and beached the sea bounty,
And how the wicked gods
Were jealous of this, and the sea-gome slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu village
Spoke those words and offered me thanks,
And how the gohei-adorned sake chopsticks came as an envoy.
Then the gods
All nodded in unison,
Praising me.
Then, again, we held a grand feast,
And the sounds of the gods
Dancing and leaping here and there
Made a beautiful sound, and my sisters
Carried choshi and went around pouring sake
Between the seats, and sang in beautiful voices
With the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful gohei each,
And the gods bent low at the waist
Many times, and
All returned to their homes.
After that, as always, my elder brothers, six in number,
My elder sisters, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
My younger brothers, six in number, were with me,
And whenever the humans made sake,
They would send sake to me and send gohei to my place.
Now, the humans have no lack of food
And live in peace without any trouble,
So I am at ease.

This is the English Translation 2.
Attoika Tomatoma-ki Kuntote-ashi Hum Hum!
Eldest brother, six brothers, eldest sister, six sisters.
Younger brother, six brothers, younger sister, six sisters.
They raised me, but what did I do?
I built a high platform in a place filled with treasures, and upon that platform,
I carved sword hilts, adorned their surfaces,
Doing nothing more,
Day after day.
Each morning, as soon as it dawned, my brothers would
Carry their quivers, going out with my sisters,
Returning at dusk, weary,
With empty hands. Though tired, my sisters would prepare the meals, setting them before me,
Then eating themselves, and cleaning up afterward.
My brothers would busily craft arrows.
When the quivers were full, everyone was exhausted,
Falling asleep with loud snores.
The next day, before the sky lightened,
Everyone would rise, my sisters preparing the meals, setting them before me.
After eating, they would again carry their quivers,
And go out. At dusk, they would once more
Return weary, with empty hands.
My sisters would prepare the meals, my brothers would craft arrows,
Day after day, always repeating the same things.
One day, my brothers and sisters again
Carried their quivers and went out.
I carved treasures, but soon
Arose and stood upon the high platform, holding
A golden small bow and golden small arrow, and went outside.
I saw the vast, calm sea,
Whales playing to the east and west.
At that moment,
To the east, my eldest sister and six sisters held hands, forming a circle,
My younger sister and six sisters drove the whales into the ring,
My eldest brother and six brothers, my younger brother and six brothers
Aimed at the whales in the circle, but the arrows
Passed beneath the whales, and flew over them.
They did this every day.
I saw in the center of the sea,
A huge whale parent and child
Playing and frolicking,
So from afar, I notched a golden small arrow to my golden small bow,
Aimed, and shot, an arrow
Piercing both whale parent and child at once.
Then, I cut one of the whales in half,
Throwing half into my sisters' circle,
And placed the other half of the whale
Beneath its tail, heading towards the land of humans,
Reaching the village of Otashutsu,
Pushing that half-whale
Onto the village's beach.
After that, I leisurely
Swam back across the sea,
When I heard someone
Running breathlessly beside me.
Looking closely, I saw it was the sea spirit, Go-me.
He said, panting:
"Tomin-karikuru Kamui-karikuru Iso-yanke-kuru
Brave god, great god,
Why do you give such a great sea blessing to lowly humans, wicked humans?
Lowly humans, wicked humans, with axes,
With sickles, hack and stab and
Scrape at the great sea blessing! Brave god,
Great god, quickly take back the great sea blessing!
Even if you give them so much sea blessing,
Lowly humans, wicked humans,
Do not appreciate it, and do such things!"
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Now that I have given it to humans,
It is theirs. Whether humans
Stab with sickles, or
Scrape with axes, it is up to them.
Let them enjoy it freely,
What does it matter?"
The sea spirit, Go-me, was somewhat at a loss,
But I paid no attention, leisurely
Swimming across the sea,
As the sun was about to set, I returned to my sea.
I saw
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, unable to carry that half-whale,
All shouting loudly,
Dragging it slowly from the east.
I felt truly helpless.
I ignored them, went straight home,
And sat on the high platform.
Then I looked back at the human world,
And saw around the half
Whale I had pushed onto the beach, gathered men in formal attire and
Women in formal attire,
Joyfully celebrating the sea blessing, with gorgeous mats spread on the dunes
Behind.
The village chief of Otashutsu,
Wore six kimonos, tightened his belt,
And wore a splendid god's crown, an ancestral crown,
A god-given sword at his waist,
Raising both hands in a godlike, beautiful pose,
Offering prayers. The humans wept,
Rejoicing in the sea blessing.
The sea spirit, Go-me, said that the humans
Hacked and stabbed the whale I had pushed up with axes and sickles,
But in fact,
The village chief led
The villagers, taking out
The divine sword, regarded since ancient times as their most precious treasure,
Using it to cut the meat, and carry it.
Moreover, there was no sign of my brothers and sisters returning.
Two or three days passed, and at the window
There seemed to be something, so I
Turned to look, and saw at the window
A golden cup filled with
Fine sake, with
Sacred sticks decorated with gohei placed upon it,
Moving back and forth, stating as a messenger:
"I am from the village of Otashutsu,
Though presumptuous, I humbly offer this fine sake."
The village chief of Otashutsu, representing
All the villagers, explained in detail the
Reason for thanking me,
"Tomin-karikuru Kamui-karikuru Iso-yanke-kuru
If not for the great god, the brave god,
Who would have had pity on our village, suffering from famine,
And driven to the brink?
You have given our village life,
We are truly grateful, and we have prepared some fine sake,
Along with small gohei,
To express our gratitude to the great god."
The sacred sticks decorated with gohei moved back and forth, stating these words.
So I rose, took the
Golden cup, raised it above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Pouring the fine sake in little by little,
And placed the golden cup on the window.
After doing this, I sat on the high platform,
And the golden cup, along with the sacred sticks,
Disappeared. After that, I continued to carve sword hilts,
Adorning their surfaces, and soon
Looking up,
The room was filled with beautiful gohei,
White clouds swirled in the room, and white lightning
Flashed. I thought it was truly beautiful.
Two or three days passed again,
And finally, I heard my brothers and
Sisters shouting loudly outside the house, dragging that whale
Back. I felt truly helpless.
I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters were all
Very tired, their faces haggard.
After everyone came in, they saw the many gohei,
And were surprised, repeatedly bowing in reverence.
Soon, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Overflowed, and the fragrance of the gods' beloved
Fine sake filled the room.
After that, I decorated the room with beautiful gohei,
Inviting distant gods, neighboring gods,
And held a grand feast. My sisters
Cooked the whale, offering it to the gods,
Who praised it highly, and were very pleased.
As the feast was in full swing, I rose,
And explained in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,
And how I had taken pity on them, pushing the sea blessing onto the beach,
And how I had treated humans kindly, but was envied by an evil god,
The sea spirit, Go-me, slandering me,
And how the village chief of Otashutsu
Had thanked me in such and such words,
The sacred sticks decorated with gohei coming as messengers,
The gods listened,
And nodded in unison,
Praising me.
After that, another grand feast was held,
The gods', there,
Here, dancing voices, leaping voices,
Making beautiful sounds, my sisters
Holding sake pots, pouring sake at the tables,
And singing beautiful songs
Together with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I gave two or three beautiful gohei
To the gods, who bowed
And repeatedly paid their respects,
And everyone returned to their homes.
After that, I was always with my eldest brother, six brothers,
Eldest sister, six sisters, younger sister, six sisters,
Younger brother, six brothers,
And whenever humans brewed sake,
They would send sake to me, and send gohei to me.
Now, humans have neither lack of food,
Nor any difficulties, living
Peacefully, so I feel at ease.

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Generally accurate, but some nuances are lost. The language is a bit plain and doesn't fully capture the poetic feel of the original chant. Some word choices could be more culturally sensitive.

#### Translation 2
More nuanced and culturally sensitive translation. Retains more of the original sentence structure and rhythm. The word choices are more evocative and appropriate for the context of an Ainu chant.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the nuances of the original Japanese text more effectively, particularly in conveying the cultural context and the speaker's tone. While Translation 1 is generally accurate, it occasionally misses subtle implications present in the source material. Translation 2 also retains more of the original sentence structure, which helps to preserve the rhythm and flow of the chant. The use of terms like 'sword hilts' and 'sacred sticks' also feels more culturally appropriate than the alternatives in Translation 1.

Attoika Tomatoma-ki Kuntote-ashi Hum Hum!

Eldest brother, six brothers, eldest sister, six sisters.
Younger brother, six brothers, younger sister, six sisters.
They raised me, but what was my purpose?
I built a high platform amidst piled treasures, and upon it,
I carved sword hilts, adorned their surfaces,
Doing nothing more,
Day after day.

Each morning, as soon as it dawned, my brothers would
Carry their quivers, going out with my sisters,
Returning at dusk, weary,
With empty hands. Though tired, my sisters would prepare the meals, setting them before me,
Then eating themselves, and cleaning up afterward.
My brothers would busily craft arrows.
When the quivers were full, everyone was exhausted,
Falling asleep with loud snores.

The next day, before the sky lightened,
Everyone would rise, my sisters preparing the meals, setting them before me.
After eating, they would again carry their quivers,
And go out. At dusk, they would once more
Return weary, with empty hands.
My sisters would prepare the meals, my brothers would craft arrows,
Day after day, always repeating the same things.

One day, my brothers and sisters again
Carried their quivers and went out.
I carved treasures, but soon
Arose and stood upon the high platform, holding
A golden small bow and golden small arrow, and went outside.
I saw the vast, calm sea,
Whales playing, splashing to the east and west.
At that moment,
To the east, my eldest sister and six sisters held hands, forming a circle,
My younger sister and six sisters drove the whales into the ring,
My eldest brother and six brothers, my younger brother and six brothers
Aimed at the whales in the circle, but the arrows
Passed beneath the whales, and flew over them.
They did this every day.

I saw in the center of the sea,
A great whale parent and child
Playing and frolicking,
So from afar, I notched a golden small arrow to my golden small bow,
Aimed, and shot, an arrow
Piercing both whale parent and child at once.
Then, I cut one of the whales in half,
Throwing half into my sisters' circle,
And placed the other half of the whale
Beneath its tail, heading towards the land of humans,
Arriving at Otasutsu village,
Pushing that half-whale
Onto the village's beach.

After that, I leisurely
Swam back across the sea,
When I heard someone
Running breathlessly beside me.
Looking closely, I saw it was the sea spirit, Go-me.
He said, panting:
"Tomin-karikuru Kamui-karikuru Iso-yanke-kuru!
Brave god, great god,
Why do you give such a great sea blessing to lowly humans, wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, with axes
And sickles, are cutting, poking,
And scraping away at the great sea bounty! Brave god,
Great god, quickly take back the great sea blessing!
Even if you give them so much sea blessing,
The lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not appreciate it, and do such things!"
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Now that I have given it to humans,
It is theirs. Whether humans
Poke at it with sickles, or scrape at it with axes,
Let them eat it as they please,
What does it matter?"
The sea spirit, Go-me, looked somewhat lost,
But I paid no attention, leisurely
Swimming across the sea,
And as the day was ending, I arrived at my sea.
There,
My twelve brothers, my twelve
Sisters, could not carry that half-whale,
All shouting loudly,
Dragging it slowly from the east.
I felt truly helpless.

I ignored them, went straight home,
And sat on the high platform.
Then I looked back at the human world,
And saw around the half
Whale I had pushed onto the beach, fine men and
Fine women were dressed in finery,
Rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty, and on the dunes behind,
A fine mat was spread,
And upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,
Wore six kimonos, tightened his belt,
And wore a splendid god's crown, an ancestral crown,
A god-given sword at his waist,
Raising both hands in a godlike, beautiful pose,
And worshipped. The humans were crying,
Rejoicing in the sea bounty.
What the Go-me said, that the humans were
Poking at the whale I had pushed up with axes and sickles,
Was not true. The village chief and
The villagers were taking out
The god sword, which they had always
Treasured most, and using it
To cut the meat and carry it away.

Moreover, there was no sign of my brothers and sisters returning.
Two or three days passed, and at the window
There seemed to be something, so I
Turned to look, and saw at the window
A golden cup filled with
Fine sake, with
Sacred sticks decorated with gohei placed upon it,
Moving back and forth, stating as a messenger:
"I am from the village of Otasutsu,
Though presumptuous, I humbly offer this fine sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu, representing
All the villagers, explained in detail the
Reason for thanking me,
"Tomin-karikuru Kamui-karikuru Iso-yanke-kuru!
If not for the great god, the brave god,
Who would have had pity on our village, suffering from famine,
And driven to the brink?
You have given our village life,
We are truly grateful, and we have prepared some fine sake,
Along with small nusa,
To express our gratitude to the great god."
The sacred sticks decorated with gohei moved back and forth, stating these words.

So I rose, took the
Golden cup, raised it above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
Pouring the fine sake in little by little,
And placed the golden cup in the window.
After doing this, I sat on the high platform,
And the golden cup, along with the sacred sticks,
Disappeared. After that, I continued to carve sword hilts,
Adorning their surfaces, and soon
Looking up,
The room was filled with beautiful gohei,
White clouds swirled in the room, and white lightning
Was flashing. I thought it was truly beautiful.

Two or three days passed again,
And finally, I heard my brothers and
Sisters shouting loudly outside the house, dragging that whale
Back. I felt truly helpless.
I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters were all
Very tired, their faces haggard.
After everyone came in, they saw the many gohei,
And were surprised, repeatedly bowing in reverence.
Soon, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
Overflowed, and the fragrance of the gods' beloved
Fine sake filled the room.

After that, I decorated the room with beautiful gohei,
Inviting distant gods, neighboring gods,
And held a grand feast. My sisters
Cooked the whale, offering it to the gods,
Who praised it highly, and were very pleased.
As the feast was in full swing, I rose,
And explained in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,
And how I had taken pity on them, pushing the sea blessing onto the beach,
And how I had treated humans kindly, but was envied by an evil god,
The sea spirit, Go-me, slandering me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu
Had thanked me in such and such words,
The sacred sticks decorated with gohei coming as messengers,
The gods listened,
And nodded in unison,
Praising me.

After that, another grand feast was held,
The gods', there,
Here, dancing voices, leaping voices,
Making beautiful sounds, my sisters
Holding choshi, pouring sake at the tables,
And singing beautiful songs
Together with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I gave two or three beautiful gohei
To the gods, who bowed
And repeatedly paid their respects,
And everyone returned to their homes.

After that, I was always with my eldest brother, six brothers,
Eldest sister, six sisters, younger sister, six sisters,
Younger brother, six brothers,
And whenever humans brewed sake,
They would send sake to me, and send gohei to me.
Now, humans have neither lack of food,
Nor any difficulties, living
Peacefully, so I feel at ease.
