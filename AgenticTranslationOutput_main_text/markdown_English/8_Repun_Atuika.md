海の神が自ら歌った謡「アトイカ
トマトマキ クントテアシ フム フム!」

アトイカ トマトマキ クントテアシ フムフム
長い兄様,六人の兄様,長い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様,短い姉様,六人の姉様が
私を育てて居たが,私は
宝物の積んである傍に高床をしつらえ,その高床の上に
すわって鞘さや刻み鞘彫り
それのみを
事として暮していた.
毎日,朝になると兄様たちは
矢筒を背負って姉様たちと一しょに出て行って
暮方になると疲れた顔色で
何も持たずに帰って来て姉様たちは
疲れているのに食事拵こしらえをし,私にお膳を出して
自分たちも食事をして食事のあとが片附くと,
それから兄様たちは矢を作るのに忙しく手を動かす.
矢筒が一ぱいになると,みんな疲れているものだから
寝ると高鼾たかいびきを響かせてねむってしまう.
その次の日になるとまだ暗い中に
みんな起きて姉様たちが食事拵えをして私に膳を出し
みんな食事が済むと,また矢筒を背負って
行ってしまう.また夕方になると
疲れた顔色で何も持たずに帰って来て
姉様たちは食事拵え,兄様たちは矢を作って,
何時いつでも同じ事をしていた.
ある日にまた兄様たち姉様たちは
矢筒を背負って出て行ってしまった.
宝物の彫刻を私はしていたがやがて
高床の上に起き上り金の小弓に
金の小矢を持って外へ出て
見ると海はひろびろと凪なぎて
海の東へ海の西へ鯨たちが
パチャパチャと遊んで居る.すると
海の東に長い姉様,六人の姉様が手をつらねて輪をつくると,
短い姉様,六人の姉様が,輪の中へ鯨を追い込む,
長い兄様,六人の兄様,短い兄様,六人の兄様が
輪の中へ鯨をねらい射つと,その鯨の
下を矢が通り上を矢が通る.
毎日毎日彼等はこんな事をして
いたのであった.見ると海の中央に
大きな鯨が親子の鯨が上へ下へ
パチャパチャと遊んで居るのが見えたので
遠い所から金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえてねらい射ったところ,一本の矢で
一度に親子の鯨を射貫いてしまった.
そこで一つの鯨のまんなかを斬って
その半分を姉様たちの輪の中へ
ほうりこんだ.それから鯨一ツ半の鯨を
尾の下にいれて人間の国に
むかって行きオタシュツ村に
着いて一ツ半の鯨を
村の浜へ押し上げてやった.
それから海の上にゆっくりと
游いで帰って
来たところが,誰かが
息を切らしてその側をはしるものがあるので
見ると,海のごめであった.
息をきらしながら云うことには,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
勇マシイ神様,大神様,
あなたはなんの為に,卑しい人間共,悪い人間共に
大きな海幸をおやりになったのです.
卑しい人間共,悪い人間共は,斧もて
鎌をもて大きな海幸をブツブツ切ったり突っついたり
削り取っています,勇ましい神様
大神様さあ早く大海幸を
お取り返しなさいませ.あんなに沢山,海幸をおやりに
なっても卑しい人間たち悪い人間たちは
有難いとも思わずこんな事をします.」
と云うので私は笑って云う
ことには,
「私は人間たちに呉れてやったものだから
今はもう自分の物だから,人間たちが
自分の持物を鎌でつつこうが斧で
削ろうがどうでも
自分たちの自由に食べたらいいではないか
それがどうなのだ.」と云うと
海のごめは所在無げにしているけれども
私はそれを少しも構わず海の上を
ゆっくりとおよいで
もう日が暮れようとしている時に,私の海へ
着いた.見ると
十二人の兄様,十二人の
姉様は,彼の半分の鯨をはこび
きれなくてみんなで掛声高く
海の東に,グズグズしている.
私は実にあきれてしまった.
私はそれに構わずに家へ
帰り,高床の上にすわった.
そこで後ふりかえって人間の世界の方を
見ると,私が打ち上げた一ツ
半の鯨のまわりをとりまいてりっぱな男たちや
りっぱな女たちが盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば歓び躍り,後の砂丘
の上にはりっぱな敷物が敷かれて
その上にオタシュツ村の村長が
六枚の着物に帯を束たばね,六枚の着物を
羽織って,りっぱな神の冠,先祖の冠を
頭に冠り,神授の剣を腰に佩はき
神の様に美しい様子で手を高くさし上げ
礼拝をしている.人間たちは泣いて
海幸をよろこんでいる.
何をごめが人間たちが
斧で鎌で私の押し上げた鯨を
突っついていると云ったが,
村長をはじめ
村民は,昔から
宝物の最も尊いものとしている神剣を取り出して
それで肉を斬って搬はこんでいる.
それから,私の兄様たち姉様たちは帰って来る
様子もない.
二日三日たった時,窗の方に
何か見える様だ,それで
振りかえって見て見ると,窗の上に
かねの盃にあふれる程
酒がはいっていてその上に
御幣を取りつけた酒箸が載っていて,
行きつ戻りつ,使者としての口上を述べて云うには,
「私はオタシュツ村の人で
畏れ多い事ながらおみきを差し上げます.」と
オタシュツ村の村長が村民
一同を代表して私に礼をのべる
次第をくわしく話し,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
大神様,勇ましい神様でなくて誰が,
この様に私たちの村に饑饉があって
もう,どうにも仕様がない程
食物に窮している時に哀れんで下されましょう.
私たちの村に生命を与えて下さいました事,
誠に有難う御座います,海幸をよろこび
少しの酒を作りまして,小さな幣ぬさを
添え,大神様に謝礼
申し上げる次第であります.」という事を
幣つきの酒箸が行きつ戻りつ申し立てた.
それで私は起き上って,かねの盃を
取り,押しいただいて
上の座の六つの酒樽の蓋ふたを開き
美酒を少しずつ入れて
かねの盃を窗の上にのせた.
それが済むと,高床の上に腰を下し
見ると彼の盃は箸と共に
なくなっていた.それから,鞘を刻み
鞘を彫り,していてやがて
ふと面をあげて見ると,
家の中は美しい幣で一ぱいになっていて
家の中は白い雲がたなびき白いいなびかりが
ピカピカ光っている.私はああ美しいと思った.
それからまた,二日三日たつと,
その時やっと,家のそとで,兄様たちや
姉様たちが掛声高く彼の鯨を
引っ張って来たのがきこえだした.私はあきれて
しまった.家の中へはいる様子を
眺めると,兄様たちや姉様たちは
たいへん疲れて,顔色も萎しおれている.
みんなはいって来て,沢山の幣を見ると,
驚いてみんななん遍もなん遍も拝した.
そのうちに,東の座の六つの酒樽は
溢れるばかりになって,神の好物の
酒の香が家の中に漂うた.
それから私は,美しい幣で家の中を飾りつけ,
遠方の神,近所の神を招待し
盛んな酒宴を張った.姉様たちは
鯨を煮て,神たちに出すと,
神たちは,舌鼓を打ってよろこんだ.
宴酣たけなわの頃私は起き上り
斯々かくかく,人間世界に饑饉があって
あわれに思い,海幸を打ち上げた次第や
人間たちをよくしてやると,悪い神々が
それをねたみ,海のごめが私に中
傷した事や,オタシュツ村の
村長が斯々の言葉をとって私に礼をのべ
幣つきの酒箸が使者になって来た事など
詳しく物語ると,神たちは
一度に揃って打ちうなずきつつ,
私をほめたたえた.
それからまた,盛な宴をはり
神たちの,そこに
ここに舞う音,躍る音は
美しき響をなし,姉様たちは
提子ちょうしを持って席の間を酌して
まわるもあり,女神たち
と共に美しい声で歌うもある.
二日三日たって宴を閉じた.
神々に美しい幣を二つ三つずつ
上げると神々は腰の央なかを
ギックリ屈めてなん遍もなん遍も礼をして,
みんな自分の家に立ち帰った.
そのあと,何時でも同じく長い兄様,六人の兄様
長い姉様,六人の姉様,短い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様と一しょにい,
人間たちが酒を造るとその度毎に
私に酒を送り私のところへ幣をよこす.
今はもう,人間たちも食物の不足も
なんの困る事も無く平穏に
暮しているので,私は安心をしています.

This is the English Translation 1.
Atoika tomatomaki kuntoteashi hum hum!

Atoika tomatomaki kuntoteashi hum hum.
My eldest brothers, six in number, my eldest sisters, six in number,
My youngest brothers, six in number, my youngest sisters, six in number,
Were raising me, but I,
Had a raised platform built beside the treasures, and upon that platform,
I sat, carving and engraving scabbards,
That alone,
Was my purpose in life.
Every day, as morning arrived, my brothers would,
Shoulder their quivers and go out with my sisters,
And as evening fell, they would return with weary faces,
Bringing nothing with them. My sisters,
Though tired, would prepare the meals, setting a tray before me,
And after they themselves had eaten and cleared away the dishes,
Then my brothers would busily make arrows.
When the quivers were full, everyone being weary,
They would sleep, their loud snores echoing.
The next day, while it was still dark,
Everyone would rise, my sisters preparing the meal and setting my tray,
And once everyone had eaten, they would again shoulder their quivers,
And depart. Again, as evening fell,
They would return with weary faces, bringing nothing with them,
My sisters would prepare the meals, my brothers would make arrows,
Always, they did the same things.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters,
Shouldered their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but soon,
I rose upon the platform, and with a golden bow,
And golden arrows, I went outside,
And saw the sea, vast and calm,
And to the east and west of the sea, whales were,
Playing with splashes. Then,
To the east of the sea, my eldest sisters, six in number, joined hands to form a ring,
My youngest sisters, six in number, drove the whales into the ring,
My eldest brothers, six in number, my youngest brothers, six in number,
Aimed and shot at the whales within the ring, their arrows,
Passing beneath and above the whales.
Every day, they did such things.
I saw in the center of the sea,
A great whale and its calf playing,
Rising and falling with splashes, so,
From afar, I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow,
Aimed, and with a single arrow,
Pierced both whale and calf at once.
Then, I cut the whale in half,
Hurling one half into my sisters' ring.
Then, with the whale and a half,
I placed it beneath its tail and went towards the land of humans,
Arriving at the village of Otasutsu,
And pushed the whale and a half,
Up onto the village's beach.
Then, I slowly,
Swam back across the sea,
When someone came running breathlessly beside me,
And I saw it was the sea-gome.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tomin karikuru Kamuy karikuru Isoyanke kuru,
Brave god, great god,
Why have you given such great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, with axes,
With sickles, are cutting, poking,
And scraping away at the great sea bounty, brave god,
great god, quickly take back the great sea bounty.
Even though you give them so much sea bounty,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
Do not feel gratitude and do such things."
So I laughed and said,
"I have given it to the humans,
Now it is theirs, so whether the humans,
Poke at their possessions with sickles or,
Scrape them with axes, is it not fine if they eat as they please?
What is wrong with that?" I said,
The sea-gome looked dismayed,
But I paid it no mind and slowly swam across the sea,
And as the day was about to end, I arrived at my sea.
I saw,
My twelve brothers, my twelve,
Sisters, unable to carry the half whale,
Were all struggling together,
East of the sea. I was truly astonished.
I paid them no mind and returned home,
And sat upon the platform.
Then, looking back towards the human world,
I saw that around the whale and a half I had beached,
Fine men and fine women were dressed in finery,
Joyfully dancing and celebrating the sea bounty, and upon the dunes behind,
Fine mats were spread,
And upon them, the village chief of Otasutsu,
With six robes and a bundled sash, wearing six robes,
And wearing a fine god's crown, an ancestral crown,
Upon his head, and wearing a divinely granted sword at his waist,
Looking as beautiful as a god, raised his hands high,
And was worshipping. The humans were crying,
And rejoicing in the sea bounty.
What the gome said, that the humans were,
Poking at the whale I had beached with axes and sickles,
The village chief and the,
villagers, since long ago,
Took out the divine sword, which they considered the most precious of treasures,
And were cutting the meat with it and carrying it away.
Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
After two or three days, something seemed to appear in the window, so,
I turned to look and saw upon the window,
A golden cup filled to overflowing,
With sake, and upon it,
Sake chopsticks adorned with Nusa, were placed,
Going back and forth, stating their message as envoys, saying,
"I am a person from the village of Otasutsu,
And with great reverence, I offer this sake." And,
The village chief of Otasutsu, representing the villagers,
Spoke in detail of their gratitude to me,
"Tomin karikuru Kamuy karikuru Isoyanke kuru,
Great god, brave god, who but you,
Would have pity on our village, which is in famine,
And is so desperately short of food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village,
Rejoicing in the sea bounty,
We have made a little sake, and added a small Nusa,
And offer our gratitude to the great god."
These things,
The Nusa-adorned sake chopsticks stated, going back and forth.
So I rose, and took the golden cup,
And reverently received it, and opened,
The lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
And poured a little of the fine sake into each,
And placed the golden cup upon the window.
When that was done, I sat down upon the platform,
And saw that the cup and chopsticks had disappeared. Then, carving scabbards,
And engraving scabbards, and soon,
I raised my face and saw,
The house was filled with beautiful Nusa,
And the house was filled with white clouds and white lightning,
Flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then again, after two or three days,
At that time, finally, outside the house, my brothers and,
Sisters were heard pulling the whale,
With loud cries. I was astonished.
Looking at how they entered the house,
My brothers and sisters were,
Very tired, their faces withered.
Everyone came in, and seeing the many Nusa,
They were surprised and bowed many times.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat,
Were overflowing, and the scent of the god's favorite,
Sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful Nusa,
Invited the gods of afar, the gods of the neighborhood,
And held a grand banquet. My sisters,
Boiled the whale, and when they offered it to the gods,
The gods smacked their lips and rejoiced.
As the banquet reached its height, I rose,
And told in detail how there was a famine in the human world,
And feeling pity, I had beached the sea bounty, and how,
When I did good to the humans, the wicked gods,
Were jealous of it, and the sea-gome slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu,
Spoke such words and offered his gratitude to me,
And how the Nusa-adorned sake chopsticks came as envoys,
And as I told these things in detail, the gods,
All nodded in unison,
Praising me.
Then again, holding a grand banquet,
The sounds of the gods,
Dancing and leaping here and there,
Made beautiful echoes, and my sisters,
Carried the Choshi and went around pouring sake between the seats,
And sang with beautiful voices along with the goddesses.
After two or three days, the banquet closed.
When I gave the gods two or three beautiful Nusa each,
The gods bent their waists,
And bowed many times,
And all returned to their own homes.
After that, as always, my eldest brothers, six in number,
My eldest sisters, six in number, my youngest sisters, six in number,
My youngest brothers, six in number, and I,
Whenever the humans made sake, they would,
Send sake to me and send Nusa to my place.
Now, the humans have no shortage of food,
And live in peace without any troubles,
So I am at ease.

This is the English Translation 2.
The sea god himself sings this song: “ATOIKA TOMATOMAKI KUNTOTEASI HUM HUM!”

ATOIKA TOMATOMAKI KUNTOTEASI HUM HUM!
My eldest brothers, six in all, my eldest sisters, six in all,
My younger brothers, six in all, my younger sisters, six in all,
They nurtured me. And I,
Built a high bed in a place overflowing with treasures, and upon that high bed,
I merely carved knife sheaths, sculpted the bodies of sheaths,
Doing only this, I passed my days.
Each day, as the morning sun rose, my brothers would
Carry their quivers, going out with my sisters,
Returning only when twilight fell, wearily,
With empty hands. Though weary, my sisters would prepare the meals, setting them before me,
They themselves would eat, and after clearing away the dishes,
My brothers would busily craft arrows.
When the quivers were full, all would,
Fall into a deep sleep from exhaustion, snoring loudly.
The next day, before dawn,
All would rise, my sisters preparing the meals, setting them before me,
Everyone would eat, then carry their quivers
And go out. As evening approached, again
Returning wearily, with empty hands,
My sisters preparing the meals, my brothers crafting arrows,
Day after day, year after year, it was always so.
One day, my brothers and sisters again
Carried their quivers and went out.
I carved treasures, and soon
Arose, standing upon my high bed, holding a
Golden small bow, golden small arrows, and went outside,
Looking out, the sea was vast and calm,
Wales frolicked on the sea's east side, the sea's west side,
Playing. Suddenly, I saw
On the sea's east side, my eldest sister, six eldest sisters, hand in hand, forming a circle,
My youngest sisters, six youngest sisters, driving whales into the circle,
My eldest brothers, six eldest brothers, my youngest brothers, six youngest brothers,
Aiming at the whales in the circle, shooting arrows that
Passed beneath the whales, grazed over the whales.
Every day, they did this.
I saw in the middle of the sea,
A giant whale, a parent whale with its child, playing
Up and down,
From afar, I notched a golden small arrow onto my golden small bow,
Aiming, I shot, and one arrow
Pierced both the parent and child whales at once.
Then, I cut one of the whales in half,
Throwing half into my sisters' circle,
And placed the other half whale
Beneath my tail, heading towards the land of humans,
Arriving at OTASUTSU village,
Pushing that half whale
Onto the village's beach.
Afterward, I leisurely
Swam in the sea, returning,
When I heard someone
Running breathlessly beside me,
Looking closely, it was a seagull.
The seagull said breathlessly:
"TOMIN KARIKURU KAMUY KARIKURU ISO YANKEKURU
Brave god, great god,
Why do you bestow such abundant sea bounty upon lowly humans, wicked humans?
Lowly humans, wicked humans, with axes,
With sickles, cut, stab,
And scrape the great sea bounty. Brave god,
Great god, quickly take back the sea bounty!
Even if you give them so much sea bounty,
Lowly humans, wicked humans,
Do not know gratitude, and instead do such things!"
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Now that I have given it to humans,
It is now theirs. What does it matter if humans
Stab with sickles, scrape
With axes?
Let them enjoy it to their hearts' content,
What does it matter?"
The seagull, hearing this, was somewhat at a loss,
But I paid it no mind, leisurely
Swimming in the sea,
As the sun set, I returned to my sea domain.
I saw
The twelve brothers, the twelve
Sisters, unable to carry that half whale,
All shouting loudly together,
Slowly moving it on the sea's east side.
I was truly astonished.
I ignored them, returning directly
Home, sitting upon my high bed.
Then I looked back towards the human world,
Seeing around that half
Whale I had pushed onto the beach, gathered men in splendid attire,
Women in splendid attire, dressed in finery,
Joyfully celebrating the sea bounty, upon the dunes behind,
Laying out splendid mats,
The village chief of OTASUTSU village
Wearing six layers of clothing, with a belt,
A splendid god's crown upon his head, an ancestral crown,
A god-given sword at his waist,
Beautiful as a god, raising both hands,
Offering prayers. The humans wept,
Rejoicing in the sea bounty.
The seagull said the humans
Stabbed the whale I pushed ashore with axes, with sickles,
But the village chief led the
Villagers, taking out
The god sword, regarded since ancient times as the most precious treasure,
Using it to cut the meat, to carry the meat.
However, my brothers, my sisters, were still not back.
Two or three days passed, and from the direction of the window
There seemed to be something, so I
Turned to look, and saw upon the window
A golden cup filled with
Fine sake, upon the cup
Lay chopsticks adorned with gohei,
Moving back and forth, as a messenger, stating:
"I am a person from OTASUTSU village,
Presumptuously offering you fine sake."
The village chief of OTASUTSU village, representing
All the villagers, expressed their gratitude to me in detail, saying:
"TOMIN KARIKURU KAMUY KARIKURU ISO YANKEKURU
If not for the great god, brave god,
Who would have pity on our village suffering from famine,
Having reached the point of having no recourse,
Lacking food?
You have given our village life,
We are truly grateful! We celebrated the sea bounty,
Brewed a little sake,
Attached a small offering of nusa, expressing our gratitude to the great god."
The chopsticks adorned with nusa moved back and forth, stating this.
So I rose, took the golden cup,
Holding it above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels above my seat,
Pouring the fine sake in little by little,
Placing the golden cup upon the window.
Having done this, I sat back upon my high bed,
And the golden cup, along with the chopsticks, had
Disappeared. Afterward, I continued carving knife sheaths,
Sculpting the bodies of sheaths, and soon
Looking up,
The room was filled with beautiful nusa,
White clouds swirled within the room, white lightning
Flashed with light. I thought it was truly beautiful.
Two or three days passed again,
And then, finally, I heard, outside, my brothers and
Sisters shouting loudly,
Pulling that whale back. I was very surprised.
I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces gaunt.
After everyone came in, seeing so much nusa,
They were surprised, bowing repeatedly.
Soon, the six sake barrels on the east side
Were overflowing, the fragrance of the sake beloved by the gods
Filled the room.
So I decorated the room with beautiful nusa,
Inviting distant gods, neighboring gods,
Holding a grand sake feast. My sisters
Cooked the whale, offering it to the gods,
The gods smacked their lips, very pleased.
As the feast was in full swing, I rose,
Explaining in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,
How I pitied them, pushing the sea bounty ashore,
And how I treated humans kindly, but was envied by wicked gods,
And how the seagull slandered me,
And how the village chief of OTASUTSU village
Expressed his gratitude to me in such and such words,
And how the chopsticks adorned with nusa came as a messenger,
The gods, hearing this,
All nodded in agreement,
Praising me.
Afterward, another grand feast was held,
The gods, there,
Here, the sounds of dancing, the sounds of leaping,
Played beautiful music, my sisters
Holding ewers, pouring sake at the tables,
And also singing with the goddesses
In beautiful voices.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I offered two or three beautiful nusa
To the gods, the gods bent
Their waists, bowing repeatedly,
And everyone returned to their own homes.
After that, as always, my eldest brothers, six eldest brothers,
My eldest sisters, six eldest sisters, my youngest sisters, six youngest sisters,
My youngest brothers, six youngest brothers, together,
Whenever the humans brewed sake, they would always
Send me sake, send me nusa.
Now, the humans have neither a lack of food,
Nor any troubles, living
Peacefully, and I am at ease.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4.5 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation is quite literal and straightforward. It accurately conveys the meaning but lacks some of the poetic flow that might be present in the original Ainu chant. The language is simple and easy to understand.

#### Translation 2
This translation is slightly more poetic and attempts to capture the rhythm of the original chant. It uses more descriptive language and maintains a better sense of the cultural context. However, some phrases might be slightly less accessible to a modern reader.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the essence and flow of the original Japanese text more effectively. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 2 uses slightly more evocative language and maintains a better sense of rhythm, making it more suitable for a chant. It also retains more of the original cultural context and nuances.

Arose, standing upon my high platform, holding a
Golden small bow, golden small arrows, and went outside,
Looking out, the sea was vast and calm,
Whales frolicked on the sea's east side, the sea's west side,
Playing. Suddenly, I saw
On the sea's east side, my eldest sisters, six in number, hand in hand, forming a circle,
My youngest sisters, six in number driving whales into the circle,
My eldest brothers, six in number, my youngest brothers, six in number,
Aiming at the whales in the circle, shooting arrows that
Passed beneath the whales, grazed over the whales.
Every day, they did this.
I saw in the middle of the sea,
A giant whale, a parent whale with its child, playing
Up and down.
From afar, I notched a golden small arrow onto my golden small bow,
Aiming, I shot, and one arrow
Pierced both the parent and child whales at once.
Then, I cut one of the whales in half,
Throwing half into my sisters' circle,
And placed the other half whale
Beneath my tail, heading towards the land of humans,
Arriving at Otasutsu village,
Pushing that half whale
Onto the village's beach.
Afterward, I leisurely
Swam in the sea, returning,
When I heard someone
Running breathlessly beside me,
Looking closely, it was a sea-gome.
The sea-gome said breathlessly:
"Tomin karikuru Kamuy karikuru Isoyanke kuru,"
Brave god, great god,
Why do you bestow such abundant sea bounty upon lowly humans, wicked humans?
Lowly humans, wicked humans, with axes,
With sickles, cut, stab,
And scrape the great sea bounty. Brave god,
Great god, quickly take back the sea bounty!
Even if you give them so much sea bounty,
Lowly humans, wicked humans,
Do not know gratitude, and instead do such things!"
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Now that I have given it to humans,
It is now theirs. What does it matter if humans
Stab with sickles, scrape
With axes?
Let them enjoy it to their hearts' content,
What does it matter?"
The sea-gome, hearing this, was somewhat at a loss,
But I paid it no mind, leisurely
Swimming in the sea,
As the sun set, I returned to my sea domain.
I saw
The twelve brothers, the twelve
Sisters, unable to carry that half whale,
All shouting loudly together,
Slowly moving it on the sea's east side.
I was truly astonished.
I ignored them, returning directly
Home, sitting upon my high platform.
Then I looked back towards the human world,
Seeing around that half
Whale I had pushed onto the beach, gathered men in splendid attire,
Women in splendid attire, dressed in finery,
Joyfully celebrating the sea bounty, upon the dunes behind,
Laying out splendid mats,
The village chief of Otasutsu village
Wearing six layers of clothing, with a belt,
A splendid god's crown upon his head, an ancestral crown,
A god-given sword at his waist,
Beautiful as a god, raising both hands,
Offering prayers. The humans wept,
Rejoicing in the sea bounty.
The sea-gome said the humans
Stabbed the whale I pushed ashore with axes, with sickles,
But the village chief led the
Villagers, taking out
The god sword, regarded since ancient times as the most precious treasure,
Using it to cut the meat, to carry the meat.
However, my brothers, my sisters, were still not back.
Two or three days passed, and from the direction of the window
There seemed to be something, so I
Turned to look, and saw upon the window
A golden cup filled with
Fine sake, upon the cup
Lay chopsticks adorned with Nusa,
Moving back and forth, as a messenger, stating:
"I am a person from Otasutsu village,
Presumptuously offering you fine sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu village, representing
All the villagers, expressed their gratitude to me in detail, saying:
"Tomin karikuru Kamuy karikuru Isoyanke kuru,"
If not for the great god, brave god,
Who would have pity on our village suffering from famine,
Having reached the point of having no recourse,
Lacking food?
You have given our village life,
We are truly grateful! We celebrated the sea bounty,
Brewed a little sake,
Attached a small offering of Nusa, expressing our gratitude to the great god."
The chopsticks adorned with Nusa moved back and forth, stating this.
So I rose, took the golden cup,
Holding it above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels above my seat,
Pouring the fine sake in little by little,
Placing the golden cup upon the window.
Having done this, I sat back upon my high platform,
And the golden cup, along with the chopsticks, had
Disappeared. Afterward, I continued carving knife sheaths,
Sculpting the bodies of sheaths, and soon
Looking up,
The room was filled with beautiful Nusa,
White clouds swirled within the room, white lightning
Flashed with light. I thought it was truly beautiful.
Two or three days passed again,
And then, finally, I heard, outside, my brothers and
Sisters shouting loudly,
Pulling that whale back. I was very surprised.
I watched them enter the house,
My brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces gaunt.
After everyone came in, seeing so much Nusa,
They were surprised, bowing repeatedly.
Soon, the six sake barrels on the east side
Were overflowing, the fragrance of the sake beloved by the gods
Filled the room.
So I decorated the room with beautiful Nusa,
Inviting distant gods, neighboring gods,
Holding a grand sake feast. My sisters
Cooked the whale, offering it to the gods,
The gods smacked their lips, very pleased.
As the feast was in full swing, I rose,
Explaining in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,
How I pitied them, pushing the sea bounty ashore,
And how I treated humans kindly, but was envied by wicked gods,
And how the sea-gome slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu village
Expressed his gratitude to me in such and such words,
And how the chopsticks adorned with Nusa came as a messenger,
The gods, hearing this,
All nodded in agreement,
Praising me.
Afterward, another grand feast was held,
The gods, there,
Here, the sounds of dancing, the sounds of leaping,
Played beautiful music, my sisters
Holding ewers, pouring sake at the tables,
And also singing with the goddesses
In beautiful voices.
Two or three days passed, and the feast ended.
I offered two or three beautiful Nusa
To the gods, the gods bent
Their waists, bowing repeatedly,
And everyone returned to their own homes.
After that, as always, my eldest brothers, six eldest brothers,
My eldest sisters, six eldest sisters, my youngest sisters, six youngest sisters,
My youngest brothers, six youngest brothers, together,
Whenever the humans brewed sake, they would always
Send me sake, send me Nusa.
Now, the humans have neither a lack of food,
Nor any troubles, living
Peacefully, and I am at ease.
