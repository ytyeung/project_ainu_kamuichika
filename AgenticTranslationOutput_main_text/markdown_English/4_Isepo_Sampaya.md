兎が自ら歌った謡「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら兄様のあとをしたって山へ行きました.
毎日毎日兄様のあとへ行って見ると
人間が弩いしゆみを仕掛けて置いてあるとその弩を兄様が
こわしてしまう,それを私は笑うのを
常としていたのでこの日また
行って見たら,ちっとも
思いがけない
兄様が弩にかかって泣き叫んでいる.
私はビックリして,兄様のそばへ
飛んで行ったら兄様は
泣きながら云うことには,
「これ弟よ,今これから
お前は走って行って
私たちの村の後へ着いたら
兄様が弩にかかったよ――,フオホホーイと
大声でよぶのだよ.」
私はきいて
ハイ,ハイ,と返辞をして,それから
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら来て
私たちの村の村後へ着きました.
そこではじめて兄様が私を使いによこしたことを
思い出しました,私は大声で叫び声を挙げようとした
が,兄様が何を言って私を使によこしてあったのか
すっかり私は忘れていました.そこに立ちつくして
思い出そうとしたがどうしてもだめだ.
それからまた
二つの谷を越え三つの谷を越え
後へ逆飛び逆躍びしながら
兄様のいる所へ来て
見ると誰もいない.
兄様の血だけがそこらに附いていた.
(ここまでで話は外へ飛ぶ)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
毎日毎日私は山へ行って
人間が弩を仕掛けてあるのをこわして
それを面白がるのが常であった所が
ある日また,前の所に弩が仕掛けて
あると,その側に小さい蓬よもぎの弩が
仕掛けてある,
私はそれを見ると
「こんな物,何にする物だろう.」
と思っておかしいので
ちょとそれに触って見た,直ぐに逃げようと
したら,思いがけ
なく,その弩にいやという程
はまってしまった.
逃げようともがけば
もがくほど,強くしめられるのでどうする事も
出来ないので,私は泣いて
いると,私の側へ何だか
飛んで来たので見るとそれは私の弟
であった.私はよろこんで,私たちの一族のものに
この事を知らせる様に言いつけてやったが
それからいくら待っても何の音もない.
私は泣いていると,私の側へ
人の影があらわれた.見ると,
神の様な美しい人間の若者
ニコニコして,私を取って,
どこかへ持って行った.見ると
大きな家の中が神の宝物で
一ぱいになっている.
彼かの若者は火を焚いて,
大きな鍋を火にかけて,掛けてある刀を引き抜いて
私のからだを皮のままブツブツに切って
鍋一ぱいに入れそれから鍋の下へ頭を突き入れ突き入れ
火を焚きつけ出した.どうかして
逃げたいので私は人間の若者の隙を
ねらうけれども,人間の若者はちっとも私から
眼をはなさない.
「鍋が煮え立って私が煮えてしまったら,なんにも
ならないつまらない死方,悪い死方をしなければならない.」と
思って人間の若者の油断を
ねらってねらって,やっとの事
一片の肉に自分を化かわらして
立ち上る湯気に身を交まじえて鍋の椽に
上り,左の座へ飛び下りると直ぐに
戸外へ飛び出した,泣きながら
飛んで息を切らして逃げて来て
私の家へ着いて
ほんとうにあぶないことであったと胸撫で下した.
後ふりかえって見ると,
ただの人間,ただの若者とばかり
思っていたのはオキキリムイ,神の様な強い方
なのでありました.
ただの人間が仕掛けた弩だと思って
毎日毎日悪戯をしたのをオキキリムイ
は大そう怒って蓬の小弩で
私を殺そうとしたのだが,私も
ただの身分の軽い神でもないのに,つまらない死方,悪い死方
をしたら,私の親類のもの共も,困り惑うであろう
事を不憫に思って下されて
おかげで,私が逃げても追いかけなかった
のでありました.
それから,前には,兎は
鹿ほども体の大きなものであったが,
この様な悪戯を私がしたために
オキキリムイの一つの肉片ほど小さくなったのです.
これからの私たちの仲間はみんなこの位の
からだになるのであろう.
これからの兎たちよ,決していたずらをしなさるな.
と,兎の首領が子供等を教えて死にました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Sanpaya Tereke
Across two valleys, leaping over three,
I followed my elder brother to the mountains, playing as we went.
Day after day, I trailed behind him,
And saw that humans had set a crossbow trap.
My brother would destroy these traps,
And I would laugh at their futile efforts.
But on this day,
Unexpectedly,
My brother was caught in a crossbow, crying out in pain.
Startled, I rushed to his side.
Weeping, he said to me,
"Oh, little brother, run now,
Go back to our village,
And shout, 'My brother is caught in a crossbow! – Hoohohooi!'
Cry it out loud."
I listened and replied,
"Yes, yes," and then,
Across two valleys, leaping over three,
I returned, playing as I went.
I arrived at the edge of our village.
Only then did I remember why my brother had sent me.
I tried to shout the message,
But I had completely forgotten what he had told me to say.
I stood there, trying to recall,
But it was no use.
Then again,
Across two valleys, over three,
I leaped and bounded back,
To where my brother was.
But he was gone.
Only his blood remained.
(Here the story takes a turn)
Ketoka woiwoi ketoka, ketoka woi ketoka
Day after day, I went to the mountains,
Destroying the crossbows that humans set,
Finding amusement in it.
Then one day, at the usual place, a crossbow was set,
And beside it, a small mugwort crossbow.
Seeing it, I thought,
"What could this be for?"
Amused, I touched it lightly.
I tried to escape immediately,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in the crossbow, held fast.
The more I struggled,
The tighter it gripped me, and I could do nothing.
I wept,
And something flew to my side.
It was my younger brother.
I rejoiced and told him to inform our kin of what had happened.
But no sound came, no one arrived.
As I wept, a shadow appeared beside me.
It was a young man, beautiful as a god.
Smiling, he took me,
And carried me away.
I saw a great house filled with divine treasures.
The young man lit a fire,
Placed a large pot over the flames, drew a knife,
And cut my body, skin and all, into pieces,
Filling the pot to the brim.
Then he thrust my head under the pot,
stoking the fire.
Desperate to escape, I watched for an opening.
But the young man never took his eyes off me.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked,
I will suffer a meaningless, terrible death."
I watched for the young man's moment of inattention,
And finally,
I transformed myself into a single piece of meat,
Mingled with the rising steam, and climbed to the pot's edge.
I leaped to the left side,
And immediately fled outdoors, weeping.
Breathless, I ran to my home,
Relieved to have escaped such danger.
Looking back,
I realized that the mere human, the mere young man,
Was Okikirmui, a god of immense power.
He was greatly angered by my daily mischief
Of destroying the crossbows that the humans set.
Okikirmui tried to kill me with the mugwort crossbow,
But I am not a god of low standing.
If I were to die a meaningless, terrible death,
My relatives would be troubled and lost.
He took pity on them and me,
And so, he did not pursue me when I fled.
From that day on, the hare,
Who was once as large as a deer,
Became as small as a piece of Okikirmui's flesh,
because of my mischief.
All of our kind will be this size from now on.
Hares of the future, never be mischievous!
So taught the leader of the hares to his children, and then he died.

This is the English Translation 2.
Across two valleys, then three,
I frolicked, following my brother into the mountains.
Day after day, I trailed behind,
Watching as he destroyed the crossbow traps set by humans.
I always laughed at this,
But on this one fateful day,
I never imagined,
My brother would be caught in a crossbow, wailing in pain.
Startled, I rushed to his side,
He cried out to me:
"Little brother, run now,
To the back of our village,
And shout – Brother is trapped by a crossbow! – フオホホーイ!"
I listened,
Responding, "Yes, yes!" And then,
Across two valleys, then three,
I skipped along,
Reaching the back of our village.
There, I remembered why my brother had sent me,
I was about to shout,
But I completely forgot what he had told me to say.
I stood there, blank, trying to recall, but I couldn't remember.
Then, again,
Across two valleys, across three valleys,
I leaped back, I raced back,
To where my brother was,
But found only emptiness.
Only my brother's blood, splattered everywhere.

ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
Day after day, I went into the mountains,
Destroying the crossbow traps set by humans,
And taking pleasure in it.
One day, I returned to the same place and found
A crossbow set there,
And beside it, a small mugwort crossbow.
Seeing it, I thought:
"What is this thing? What use is it?"
Finding it laughable, I
Touched it slightly, intending to run away immediately,
But never imagined,
I would be tightly trapped by that crossbow.
The more I struggled,
The tighter it became, and I was helpless, only able to weep.
At that moment, something
Flew to my side, and I saw it was my little brother.
Overjoyed, I told him to inform our kin,
But waited for a long time, yet heard nothing.
As I wept,
A figure appeared beside me, and I saw
A human youth, beautiful as a god.
Smiling, he seized me,
And took me to a place. I saw,
It was a huge house, filled with sacred treasures.
The youth lit a fire,
Placed a large pot over the flames, drew a hanging knife,
Chopped my body, skin and bones, into small pieces,
Filled the entire pot, then held the bottom of the pot to my head, constantly
Lighting the fire and boiling me. I desperately wanted to
Escape, so I watched for an opening in the human youth's attention,
But he watched me without blinking.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked to mush,
It will be a meaningless death, a death without a burial place."
Thinking this, I watched for a moment of carelessness from the human youth,
Finally, I transformed myself into a slice of meat,
Mixed into the rising steam, climbed onto the edge of the pot,
Jumped onto the seat to the left, and immediately
Rushed out of the house, weeping,
Panting, I fled back to my home,
Relieved to have escaped with my life.
Looking back,
I had thought he was just an ordinary human, an ordinary youth,
But I never imagined he was オキキリムイ, a being as powerful as a god.
I had thought they were just crossbows set by humans, so I
Played pranks day after day,
オキキリムイ was very angry about this, and used a small mugwort crossbow
To try to kill me, but I am not
Just a god of low status, if I were to die meaninglessly, without a burial place,
My kin would be confused and saddened,
He pitied us,
Therefore, when I ran away, he did not chase after me.
From then on, originally
Rabbits had bodies as large as deer,
But because I played such a prank,
I became as small as a slice of meat from オキキリムイ.
From now on, our companions will all be this size.
From now on, rabbits, never play pranks again.
The rabbit leader taught the children this, and then passed away.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4.5 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is a straightforward and clear rendition of the Japanese text into English. It is easily understandable and maintains the narrative flow. However, it lacks some of the cultural nuances and poetic elements present in the original Ainu chant.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is more evocative and culturally sensitive. It retains some of the original Japanese terms, adding depth to the translation. The language used is slightly more poetic, capturing the essence of a traditional chant. However, it could be slightly improved in terms of clarity in certain phrases.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the nuances and cultural elements of the Ainu chant more effectively. It retains the original term "フオホホーイ" and "オキキリムイ", preserving the cultural context. The language used is also slightly more evocative and closer to the original intent. While both translations are good, Translation 2 edges out Translation 1 in terms of cultural accuracy and poetic feel.
