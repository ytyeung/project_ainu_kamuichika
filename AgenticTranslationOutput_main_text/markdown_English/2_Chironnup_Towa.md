狐が自ら歌った謡「トワトワト」

トワトワト
ある日に海辺へ食物を拾いに
出かけました.
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行きながら自分の行手を見たところが
海辺に鯨が寄り上って
人間たちがみんな盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば喜び躍り肉を切る者運ぶ者が
行き交かって重立った人たちは海幸をば謝し拝む者
刀をとぐ者など浜一ぱいに黒く見えます.
私はそれを見ると大層喜びました.
「ああ早くあそこへ着いて
少しでもいいから貰いたいものだ」と
思って「ばんざーい! ばんざーい」と
叫びながら
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行って行って近くへ行って見ましたら
ちっとも思いがけなかったのに
鯨が上ったのだとばかり思ったのは
浜辺に犬どもの便所があって
大きな糞の山があります,
それを鯨だと私は思ったので
ありました.
人間たちが海幸をば喜んで躍り海幸をば喜び舞い
肉を切ったりはこんだりしているのだと
私が思ったのはからすどもが
糞をつっつき糞を散らし散らし
その方へ飛びこの方へ飛びしているのでした.
私は腹が立ちました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
海のそばから走りながら
見たところが私の行手に
舟があってその舟の中で
人間が二人互いにお悔みをのべています,
「おや,何の急変が
あるのでああいう事をしているのだろう,もしや
舟と一しょに引繰ひっくりかえった人でもあるのではないかしら,
おお早くずっと近くへ行って
人の話を聞きたいものだ.」
と思うのでフオホホーイと
高く叫んで
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして行って見たら
舟だと思ったのは浜辺にある
岩であって,人だと思ったのは
二羽の大きな鵜であったのでした.
二羽の大きな鵜が長い首をのばしたり縮めたり
しているのを悔みを言い合っている様に
私は見たのでありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして川をのぼって行きましたところが
ずーっと川上に女が二人
浅瀬に立っていて泣き合っています.
私はそれを見てビックリして
「おや,なんの悪い事があって
なんの凶報が来てあんなに泣き合って
いるのだろう?
ああ早く着いて人の話を
聞きたいものだ.」
と思って
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして行って見たら
川の中程に二つの簗やながあって
二つの簗の杭くいが流れにあたってグラグラ動いているのを
二人の女がうつむいたり仰むいたりして
泣き合っているのだと私は思ったの
でありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた,川をのぼって
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして帰って来ました.
自分の行手を見ましたところが
どうしたのだか
私の家が燃えあがって
大空へ立ちのぼる煙は
立ちこめた雲の様です.それを見た私は
ビックリして気を失うほど
驚きました.女の声で叫びながら
飛び上りますと,むこうから誰かが
大きな声でホーイと叫びながら私のそばへ
飛んで来ました.見るとそれは私の妻で
ビックリした顔色で息せききって,
「旦那様どうしたのですか?」
と云うので,見ると
火事の様に見えたのに
私の家はもとのまま
たっています.火もなし,煙もありません.
それは,私の妻が搗物つきものをしていると
その時に風が強く吹いて簸ている粟の
糠ぬかが吹き飛ばされるさまを
煙の様に私は見たのでありました.
食物を探しに出かけても食物も見付からず,その上に
また,私が大声を上げたので私の妻が
それに驚いて簸ていた粟をも
簸と一しょに放り飛ばしてしまったので
今夜は食べる事も出来ません
私は腹立たしくて床の底へ
身を投げて寝てしまいました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」

狐の頭かしらが物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Towatowato.
One day, I went to the seashore to gather food.
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
As I went, I looked ahead and saw
A whale had washed ashore.
The people were all dressed in finery,
Rejoicing in the sea's bounty, dancing in joy,
Some cutting the meat, others carrying it away.
The important people offered thanks and prayers,
Some sharpening their knives—the beach was black with them.
Seeing this, I was overjoyed.
"Ah, I must hurry there,
And get even a little bit!" I thought,
And shouting, "Banzai! Banzai!"
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
I went closer and closer, but then I saw,
Unexpectedly,
That what I thought was a whale ashore
Was just a dog's toilet on the beach,
A great mountain of dung.
That is what I had mistaken for a whale.
And what I thought were people rejoicing in the sea's bounty, dancing in joy,
Cutting and carrying the meat,
Were just crows pecking at the dung,
Scattering it this way and that,
Flying here and there.
I was furious.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Filthy water dripping from your backside!
What kind of vision is this?"
Then again,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
Running from the seashore,
I saw in the distance
A boat, and in the boat
Two people exchanging condolences.
"Oh, what sudden event
Has caused them to do such a thing? Perhaps
Someone has capsized with the boat?
Ah, I must go closer
And hear what they are saying!"
So I shouted loudly, "Hoho-hoi!"
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
I flew as if on wings, but what I thought was a boat
Was just a rock on the beach,
And what I thought were people
Were just two large cormorants.
I saw the two large cormorants stretching and retracting their long necks,
And mistook it for them exchanging condolences.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Filthy water dripping from your backside!
What kind of vision is this?"
Then again,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
I flew as if on wings, going up the river,
And far upstream
Two women were standing in the shallows, weeping together.
I was startled by this.
"Oh, what evil has occurred?
What ill tidings have arrived that they weep so?
Ah, I must hurry and hear what they are saying!"
So,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
I flew as if on wings, but what I saw
Were two yana in the middle of the river,
The posts of the two yana shaking in the current,
And I thought the two women were looking up and down at them,
Weeping together.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Filthy water dripping from your backside!
What kind of vision is this?"
Then again, I went up the river,
Chara-chara through the stones,
Chara-chara through the wood chips.
I flew as if on wings, returning home.
I looked ahead and saw
That somehow
My house was ablaze,
The smoke rising into the sky
Like gathering clouds. Seeing this, I
Was so startled I nearly fainted.
I leaped up, shouting in a woman's voice,
And from the other side, someone
Came flying towards me, shouting loudly, "Hoi!"
It was my wife, her face pale with shock, breathless.
"Husband, what is it?" she said.
And then I saw
That what looked like a fire
Was just my house as it always was.
No fire, no smoke.
It was just that my wife was hulling grain,
And the wind was blowing strongly,
And I mistook the blown-away chaff
For smoke.
I had gone out to find food but found none, and then
Because I shouted so loudly, my wife
Was so startled that she threw away the grain
Along with the winnowing basket,
So now we have nothing to eat tonight.
I was furious, and threw myself onto the floor
And went to sleep.
"Blind, worthless fool!
Blind, wicked fool!
Stinky one beneath the tail!
Rotten one beneath the tail!
Pitch oozing from your backside!
Filthy water dripping from your backside!
What kind of vision is this?"
So the fox's head told the story.

This is the English Translation 2.
Towa towa to.
One day, I went to the seaside, seeking food.
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
As I walked, I gazed afar,
And saw upon the shore, a beached whale.
The people were adorned, joyful and excited,
Celebrating the sea's bounty, singing and dancing,
Those cutting the flesh, those carrying it, never ceasing,
The respected elders, thanking the sea, praying sincerely,
Those sharpening knives, covering the beach, a dark mass.
Seeing this scene, my heart was gladdened.
"Ah, if only I had arrived sooner,
Even a little would have satisfied me."
Thinking thus, I shouted, "Hooray! Hooray!"
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Approaching closer, I finally saw,
That it was different from what I thought.
What I thought was a beached whale,
Was actually a place where dogs relieve themselves on the beach,
A mountain of feces.
I had mistaken it for a whale.
What I thought were people celebrating the sea's bounty, singing and dancing,
Cutting flesh and carrying it, a lively scene,
Were actually crows gathering,
Pecking at the feces, scattering everywhere.
My anger flared.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Then again,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Running from the seaside, I looked ahead,
And saw in the distance, a boat,
In the boat, two people, mourning each other.
"Eh, could there be some sudden change,
That has led to this? Perhaps
Someone has capsized at sea, boat and all?"
"Ah, if only I could get closer sooner,
To hear what the people are saying."
Thinking thus, I shouted, "Ho oh ho-i!"
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing forth, I finally saw,
That what I thought was a boat, was actually a rock on the beach,
What I thought were people, were actually
Two large pelicans.
Two large pelicans, stretching their necks, sometimes retracting them,
I had mistaken them for mourning each other.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Then again,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing up, going up the river,
I saw in the distance, two women,
Standing in the shallows, embracing and weeping.
Seeing this scene, I was greatly surprised.
"Eh, could there be some ominous event,
Could there be some dangerous news, that has led to such weeping?"
"Ah, if only I could arrive sooner,
To hear what the people are saying."
Thinking thus,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing forth, I finally saw,
That in the middle of the river, there were two fish weirs,
The stakes of the fish weirs, battered by the water, swaying,
I had mistaken the two women for embracing and weeping.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Then again, going up the river,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing back.
Gazing ahead,
For some reason,
My house was ablaze,
Smoke rising to the sky,
Like layers of clouds.
Seeing this scene, I was terrified,
And lost my senses.
Screaming like a woman, leaping into the air,
I suddenly saw someone in the distance,
Shouting "Hey!", running towards me.
Looking closely, it was my wife,
Her face terrified, panting,
"Husband, what has happened?"
Looking again carefully,
What seemed like a fire,
Was actually my house safe and sound,
No fire, no smoke.
It turned out, my wife was milling rice,
At this moment, a strong wind blew,
Scattering the chaff of the rice,
I had mistaken it for smoke.
Going out to seek food, I found nothing,
And because I had shouted loudly,
I had frightened my wife,
So much so that she threw away the rice along with the winnowing basket,
Tonight, we will have nothing to eat.
I was furious, and lay down under the bed,
And fell asleep.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Thus spoke the fox leader.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.2 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation is accurate and easy to understand, but it lacks some of the poetic flow present in the original Japanese. Some phrases are translated very literally, which makes the text sound a bit plain.

#### Translation 2
This translation captures the poetic feel of the original Japanese text more effectively. The word choices are more evocative, and the rhythm is more consistent. However, some phrases could be slightly more accessible to a modern English reader.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is better because it maintains a more consistent tone and rhythm, reflecting the original Japanese text's chanting style. It also uses slightly more evocative language, enhancing the poetic feel. While both translations are accurate, Translation 2's stylistic choices make it a better fit for the source material.

Towa towa to.
One day, seeking food, I went to the shore.
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
As I journeyed, I gazed afar,
And saw upon the beach, a whale, it seemed.
The people adorned, joyful and excited,
Celebrating the sea's bounty, singing, and dancing,
Those cutting the flesh, those carrying it, never ceasing,
The elders respected, thanking the sea, praying sincerely,
Those sharpening knives, covering the beach, a dark mass.
Seeing this scene, my heart leaped with joy.
"Ah, if only I had arrived sooner,
Even a little would have satisfied me."
Thinking thus, I shouted, "Hooray! Hooray!"
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Approaching closer, I finally perceived,
That it was different from what I believed.
What I thought was a beached whale,
Was merely where dogs relieve themselves on the beach,
A mountain of dung, foul and high.
I had mistaken it for a whale, a foolish lie.
What I thought were people celebrating the sea's bounty, singing and dancing,
Cutting flesh and carrying it, a lively scene enhancing,
Were actually crows gathering,
Pecking at the feces, scattering everywhere, bothering.
My anger flared, a burning brand.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Then again,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Running from the seaside, I looked ahead,
And saw in the distance, a boat instead,
In the boat, two people, mourning each other's plight.
"Eh, could there be some sudden change in sight,
That has led to this? Perhaps
Someone has capsized at sea, boat and perhaps all?"
"Ah, if only I could get closer sooner,
To hear what the people are saying, a somber tune."
Thinking thus, I shouted, "Ho oh ho-i!"
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing forth, I finally discerned,
That what I thought was a boat, was a rock, lesson learned,
What I thought were people, were actually,
Two large cormorants, standing factually.
Two large cormorants, stretching their necks, sometimes retracting,
I had mistaken them for mourning, my mind distracting.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Then again,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing up, going up the river,
I saw in the distance, two women, a shiver,
Standing in the shallows, embracing and weeping, a mournful cry.
Seeing this scene, I was greatly surprised, passing by.
"Eh, could there be some ominous event,
Could there be some dangerous news, heaven-sent,
That has led to such weeping?"
"Ah, if only I could arrive sooner, keeping,
To hear what the people are saying."
Thinking thus, staying,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing forth, I finally understood,
That in the middle of the river, there were two fish weirs, good,
The stakes of the fish weirs, battered by the water, swaying,
I had mistaken the two women for embracing and weeping, betraying.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Then again, going up the river,
Among the pebbles, shala shala,
Between the driftwood, shala shala.
Rushing back, no deliver.
Gazing ahead, no endeavor,
For some reason, whatever,
My house was ablaze, forever,
Smoke rising to the sky, higher,
Like layers of clouds, a funeral pyre.
Seeing this scene, I was terrified, dire,
And lost my senses, desired.
Screaming like a woman, leaping into the air, higher,
I suddenly saw someone in the distance, a crier,
Shouting "Hey!", running towards me, nigher.
Looking closely, it was my wife, liar,
Her face terrified, panting, a prior,
"Husband, what has happened?", a quire.
Looking again carefully, entire,
What seemed like a fire, supplier,
Was actually my house safe and sound, higher,
No fire, no smoke, no pyre.
It turned out, my wife was milling rice, supplier,
At this moment, a strong wind blew, higher,
Scattering the chaff of the rice, a buyer,
I had mistaken it for smoke, a crier.
Going out to seek food, I found nothing, dire,
And because I had shouted loudly, higher,
I had frightened my wife, a quire,
So much so that she threw away the rice along with the winnowing basket, supplier,
Tonight, we will have nothing to eat, no buyer.
I was furious, and lay down under the bed, dire,
And fell asleep, no thread.
"You fools with blurred vision,
You villains with blurred vision,
The stench from under your tails,
The decay from under your tails,
You who exude resin from your anuses,
You who exude filth from your anuses,
What kind of eyes do you have!"
Thus spoke the fox leader, no reader.
