狐が自ら歌った謡「トワトワト」

トワトワト
ある日に海辺へ食物を拾いに
出かけました.
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行きながら自分の行手を見たところが
海辺に鯨が寄り上って
人間たちがみんな盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば喜び躍り肉を切る者運ぶ者が
行き交かって重立った人たちは海幸をば謝し拝む者
刀をとぐ者など浜一ぱいに黒く見えます.
私はそれを見ると大層喜びました.
「ああ早くあそこへ着いて
少しでもいいから貰いたいものだ」と
思って「ばんざーい! ばんざーい」と
叫びながら
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行って行って近くへ行って見ましたら
ちっとも思いがけなかったのに
鯨が上ったのだとばかり思ったのは
浜辺に犬どもの便所があって
大きな糞の山があります,
それを鯨だと私は思ったので
ありました.
人間たちが海幸をば喜んで躍り海幸をば喜び舞い
肉を切ったりはこんだりしているのだと
私が思ったのはからすどもが
糞をつっつき糞を散らし散らし
その方へ飛びこの方へ飛びしているのでした.
私は腹が立ちました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
海のそばから走りながら
見たところが私の行手に
舟があってその舟の中で
人間が二人互いにお悔みをのべています,
「おや,何の急変が
あるのでああいう事をしているのだろう,もしや
舟と一しょに引繰ひっくりかえった人でもあるのではないかしら,
おお早くずっと近くへ行って
人の話を聞きたいものだ.」
と思うのでフオホホーイと
高く叫んで
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして行って見たら
舟だと思ったのは浜辺にある
岩であって,人だと思ったのは
二羽の大きな鵜であったのでした.
二羽の大きな鵜が長い首をのばしたり縮めたり
しているのを悔みを言い合っている様に
私は見たのでありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして川をのぼって行きましたところが
ずーっと川上に女が二人
浅瀬に立っていて泣き合っています.
私はそれを見てビックリして
「おや,なんの悪い事があって
なんの凶報が来てあんなに泣き合って
いるのだろう?
ああ早く着いて人の話を
聞きたいものだ.」
と思って
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして行って見たら
川の中程に二つの簗やながあって
二つの簗の杭くいが流れにあたってグラグラ動いているのを
二人の女がうつむいたり仰むいたりして
泣き合っているのだと私は思ったの
でありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた,川をのぼって
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして帰って来ました.
自分の行手を見ましたところが
どうしたのだか
私の家が燃えあがって
大空へ立ちのぼる煙は
立ちこめた雲の様です.それを見た私は
ビックリして気を失うほど
驚きました.女の声で叫びながら
飛び上りますと,むこうから誰かが
大きな声でホーイと叫びながら私のそばへ
飛んで来ました.見るとそれは私の妻で
ビックリした顔色で息せききって,
「旦那様どうしたのですか?」
と云うので,見ると
火事の様に見えたのに
私の家はもとのまま
たっています.火もなし,煙もありません.
それは,私の妻が搗物つきものをしていると
その時に風が強く吹いて簸ている粟の
糠ぬかが吹き飛ばされるさまを
煙の様に私は見たのでありました.
食物を探しに出かけても食物も見付からず,その上に
また,私が大声を上げたので私の妻が
それに驚いて簸ていた粟をも
簸と一しょに放り飛ばしてしまったので
今夜は食べる事も出来ません
私は腹立たしくて床の底へ
身を投げて寝てしまいました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」

狐の頭かしらが物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
Towatowato,
One day, I went to the seaside to gather food.
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
As I went, I looked ahead and saw
A whale had washed ashore.
The people were all in festive attire,
Rejoicing in the bounty of the sea, dancing in celebration.
Some cut the meat, others carried it.
The important people offered thanks and prayers to the sea.
Some sharpened their knives; the beach was black with people.
Seeing this, I was overjoyed.
"Ah, I must hurry and arrive there soon,
I want to receive even just a little," I thought,
And shouting, "Banzai! Banzai!"
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I went closer and closer, but then,
Unexpectedly,
What I thought was a whale ashore
Was just a dog's toilet on the beach,
A great mountain of dung.
That is what I had mistaken for a whale.
What I thought were people rejoicing in the sea's bounty,
Cutting and carrying meat,
Were just crows
Pecking at the dung, scattering it about,
Flying this way and that.
I was furious.
"Blind, insignificant fool,
Blind, wicked wretch,
Stinky thing beneath the tail,
Rotten thing beneath the tail,
Pitch oozing from your rear,
Filthy water flowing from your rear,
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
Running from the seaside,
I saw in the distance
A boat, and in that boat
Two people were exchanging condolences.
"Oh, what sudden event
Has caused them to do such a thing? Perhaps
Someone has capsized with the boat.
Ah, I must go closer and listen
To what they are saying."
So, I cried out, "Hoho-hoi!"
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew as if on wings to see,
But what I thought was a boat was just
A rock on the beach, and what I thought were people
Were just two large cormorants.
The two large cormorants were stretching and retracting
Their long necks, and I saw them as if they were
Exchanging condolences.
"Blind, insignificant fool,
Blind, wicked wretch,
Stinky thing beneath the tail,
Rotten thing beneath the tail,
Pitch oozing from your rear,
Filthy water flowing from your rear,
What a way to see things!"
Then again,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew up the river,
And far upstream,
Two women were standing in the shallows,
Weeping together.
I was startled to see this.
"Oh, what misfortune has occurred,
What ill tidings have arrived
That they weep together so?
Ah, I must hurry and arrive and listen
To what they are saying."
So,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew as if on wings to see,
But in the middle of the river were two fish weirs (yana),
And the posts of the two weirs
Were shaking in the current,
And I thought the two women were looking up and down at them,
Weeping together.
"Blind, insignificant fool,
Blind, wicked wretch,
Stinky thing beneath the tail,
Rotten thing beneath the tail,
Pitch oozing from your rear,
Filthy water flowing from your rear,
What a way to see things!"
Then again, I went up the river,
Among the stones, chara-chara,
Among the driftwood, chara-chara.
I flew as if on wings and returned.
I looked ahead and saw
That, for some reason,
My house was ablaze,
The smoke rising into the sky
Like gathering clouds. Seeing this, I
Was so startled I nearly fainted.
I leaped up, crying out in a woman's voice,
And from the other side,
someone came flying toward me,
Shouting loudly, "Hoi!" It was my wife,
Her face pale with shock, breathless.
"Husband, what has happened?" she asked.
I looked, and what had seemed like a fire,
My house stood as before.
No fire, no smoke.
It was just that my wife was hulling grain (tsukimono),
And at that moment, the wind blew strongly,
And the blown-away rice bran (nuka)
Was what I had seen as smoke.
I had gone out to find food but found none, and on top of that,
Because I shouted so loudly, my wife
Was so startled that she threw away the grain she was hulling
Along with the hull.
So, tonight we have nothing to eat.
I was furious and threw myself
Under the bed and went to sleep.
"Blind, insignificant fool,
Blind, wicked wretch,
Stinky thing beneath the tail,
Rotten thing beneath the tail,
Pitch oozing from your rear,
Filthy water flowing from your rear,
What a way to see things!"
So,
The fox's head told the story.

This is the English Translation 2.
Towa Towa Towa, the story unfolds,

One day, I ventured to the shore, seeking sustenance.
Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
As I walked, gazing ahead,
I saw upon the beach, a whale lay stranded.
People adorned in finery,
Celebrating the sea's bounty, dancing and singing;
Rejoicing in the ocean's gift, leaping with joy.
Some carved the whale's flesh, others carried it away.
The esteemed elders, giving thanks to the sea god, worshipping devoutly.
Wielders of sharpened knives, scattered across the beach, a dark, dense throng.

Seeing this spectacle, my heart leaped with joy.
"Ah, how I long to reach there swiftly,
Even a small piece would suffice."
I cried out, "Banzai! Banzai!"

Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
I journeyed onward, drawing closer, only to find,
That reality betrayed my hopes.
What I thought was a beached whale,
Was but a place on the shore where dogs relieve themselves,
A mountain of excrement.
I had mistaken it for a whale.

I thought people celebrated the sea's bounty, dancing and singing;
Thought they carved whale meat, busily carrying it away,
But in truth, it was crows,
Pecking at the dung, scattering it about,
Flying hither and thither.

My anger flared.
"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How do you perceive the world!"

Then again, I heard
Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
I ran along the shore,
And in the distance, I saw a boat.
Upon the boat were two figures, exchanging words of mourning.
"Eh, what calamity has befallen?
Why do they act in such a way? Could it be
Someone has capsized with their vessel?
Ah, how I long to draw near,
To hear what they are saying."
So I cried out, "Ohohooi!"

Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
I rushed forth, drawing closer, only to find,
What I thought was a boat, was but a
Rock upon the shore. What I thought were people,
Were but two great pelicans.
Two great pelicans, stretching and retracting their necks,
Whom I had mistaken for mourners.

"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How do you perceive the world!"

After that, again I heard
Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
I hurried against the current,
And in the distance, upstream, were two women
Standing in the shallows, weeping to each other.
Seeing this, I was greatly alarmed.
"Eh, what misfortune has occurred?
What ill tidings have arrived, that cause them such sorrow?
Ah, how I long to hasten there,
To hear what they are saying."
So I heard
Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
I rushed forth, drawing closer, only to find,
That in the river's center were two fish weirs,
The wooden stakes of the weirs, battered by the current, teetering.
Whom I had mistaken for two women, heads bowed and raised,
Weeping to each other.

"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How do you perceive the world!"

After that, I went against the current again,
Among the pebbles, a rustling sound;
Between the driftwood, a whispering noise.
I hurried home.
I gazed ahead,
And I don't know what happened,
My house was engulfed in flames,
The thick smoke rising to the sky,
Like piled-up clouds. Seeing this,
I was terrified, nearly fainting.
I let out a woman's scream,
And jumped up. From across, someone
Shouted "Hey!" and ran
Toward me. Looking closely, it was my wife,
Her face filled with terror, breathlessly asking:
"What's wrong, my lord?"
Looking more closely,
What seemed like a fire,
My house stood there unharmed.
No fire, no smoke.
It turned out, my wife was hulling rice,
The wind was strong, scattering the chaff of the millet being winnowed,
Which I had mistaken for smoke.

I went out seeking food, but found nothing,
And I shouted loudly,
My wife was startled by my cries,
And threw away the millet she was winnowing,
Along with the winnowing basket.
Tonight, we will likely go hungry.
I was filled with frustration, and collapsed under the bed,
And fell asleep.

"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How do you perceive the world!"

Thus spoke the head of the foxes.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.2 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
This translation is quite literal and easy to understand. It maintains accuracy but lacks a strong poetic flow. The repetition of 'chara-chara' is translated directly, which is accurate but could be more creatively rendered.

#### Translation 2
This translation has a better poetic flow and uses more evocative language. It captures the feeling of a chant more effectively. However, some phrases are less straightforward and might require more interpretation. The translation of 'chara-chara' as 'a rustling sound' and 'a whispering noise' is more creative and fitting.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 has a better poetic flow and captures the essence of the Ainu chant more effectively. While Translation 1 is more literal and easier to understand, it lacks the rhythmic quality and evocative language present in Translation 2. Given the weighting, the improved poetic flow and meaning accuracy of Translation 2 outweigh the slightly better understandability of Translation 1.

Towa Towa Towa, the tale is spun,

One day, I wandered to the shore, seeking sustenance.
Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
As I journeyed on, gazing afar,
I saw upon the strand, a whale lay beached.
People arrayed in finery,
Celebrating the sea's bounty, dancing and chanting;
Rejoicing in the ocean's gift, leaping with delight.
Some carved the great beast, others bore it away.
The esteemed elders, giving thanks to the sea, worshipping deeply.
Wielders of keen blades, scattered across the shore, a dark and bustling throng.

Seeing this grand sight, my heart surged with joy.
"Ah, how I yearn to reach there swiftly,
Even a meager morsel would suffice."
I cried out, "Banzai! Banzai!"

Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
I journeyed onward, drawing closer, only to find,
That reality betrayed my eager hopes.
What I thought was a whale upon the sand,
Was but a place where dogs relieve themselves on the shore,
A mountain of dung, foul and immense.
I had mistaken it for a whale, a feast imagined.

I thought people celebrated the sea's bounty, dancing and singing;
Thought they carved whale meat, busily carrying it away,
But in truth, it was crows,
Pecking at the dung, scattering it wide,
Flying hither and thither, a black and raucous cloud.

My anger flared, a burning ember.
"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How twisted is your sight!"

Then again, I heard
Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
I ran along the shore,
And in the distance, I saw a boat, a silhouette upon the waves.
Upon the boat were two figures, exchanging words of sorrow.
"Eh, what calamity has befallen?
Why do they act in such despair? Could it be
Someone has capsized with their vessel, lost to the sea?
Ah, how I yearn to draw near,
To hear their mournful tale."
So I cried out, "Ohohooi!"

Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
I rushed forth, drawing closer, only to find,
What I thought was a boat, was but a
Rock upon the shore, weathered and worn.
What I thought were people,
Were but two great cormorants, perched and still.
Two great cormorants, stretching and retracting their necks,
Whom I had mistaken for mourners, lamenting their fate.

"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How twisted is your sight!"

After that, again I heard
Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
I hurried against the current, up the river's course,
And in the distance, upstream, were two women
Standing in the shallows, weeping to each other, a sorrowful sight.
Seeing this, I was greatly alarmed.
"Eh, what misfortune has occurred?
What ill tidings have arrived, that cause them such grief?
Ah, how I yearn to hasten there,
To hear their woeful cries."
So I heard
Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
I rushed forth, drawing closer, only to find,
That in the river's center were two fish weirs (yana),
The wooden stakes of the weirs, battered by the current, teetering and worn.
Whom I had mistaken for two women, heads bowed and raised,
Weeping to each other, a vision of despair.

"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How twisted is your sight!"

After that, I went against the current again,
Among the pebbles, a rustling whisper;
Between the driftwood, a murmuring sigh.
I hurried home, my spirit weary.
I gazed ahead, my heart filled with dread,
And I don't know what happened, a trick of the light,
My house was engulfed in flames, or so it seemed,
The thick smoke rising to the sky,
Like piled-up clouds, a terrifying vision.
Seeing this, I was terrified, nearly fainting, my senses reeling.
I let out a woman's scream, a cry of pure anguish,
And jumped up. From across, someone
Shouted "Hey!", and ran
Toward me, a figure in the haze.
Looking closely, it was my wife, her face etched with fear, breathlessly asking:
"What's wrong, my lord? What troubles you so?"
Looking more closely, my eyes now clear,
What seemed like a fire, a scene of destruction,
My house stood there unharmed, a comforting sight.
No fire, no smoke, only the familiar walls.
It turned out, my wife was hulling grain (tsukimono),
The wind was strong, scattering the chaff of the millet being winnowed,
Which I had mistaken for smoke, a phantom of my mind.

I went out seeking food, but found nothing, my quest in vain,
And I shouted loudly, my voice filled with woe,
My wife was startled by my cries, her hands trembling,
And threw away the millet she was winnowing,
Along with the winnowing basket, our sustenance lost.
Tonight, we will likely go hungry, our bellies empty.
I was filled with frustration, and collapsed under the bed, my spirit crushed,
And fell asleep, a slumber of discontent.

"Truly short-sighted fools,
Truly dim-eyed villains!
Creatures reeking of stench from beneath their tails,
Creatures rotting from beneath their tails,
Whose anuses drip with resin,
Whose anuses ooze with filth!
How twisted is your sight!"

Thus spoke the head of the foxes, his tale now done.
