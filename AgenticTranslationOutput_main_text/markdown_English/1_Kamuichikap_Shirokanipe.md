梟の神の自ら歌った謡
「銀の滴しずく降る降るまわりに」

「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,金の滴
降る降るまわりに.」という歌を私は歌いながら
流に沿って下り,人間の村の上を
通りながら下を眺めると
昔の貧乏人が今お金持になっていて,昔のお金持が
今の貧乏人になっている様です.
海辺に人間の子供たちがおもちゃの小弓に
おもちゃの小矢をもってあそんで居ります.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながら子供等の上を
通りますと,(子供等は)私の下を走りながら
云うことには,
「美しい鳥! 神様の鳥!
さあ,矢を射てあの鳥
神様の鳥を射当てたものは,一ばんさきに取った者は
ほんとうの勇者,ほんとうの強者だぞ.」
云いながら,昔貧乏人で今お金持になってる者の
子供等は,金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえて私を射ますと,金の小矢を
私は下を通したり上を通したりしました.
その中に,子供等の中に
一人の子供がただの(木製の)小弓にただの小矢
を持って仲間にはいっています.私はそれを見ると
貧乏人の子らしく,着物でも
それがわかります.けれどもその眼色を
よく見ると,えらい人の子孫らしく,一人変り
者になって仲間入りをしています.自分もただの小弓に
ただの小矢を番えて私をねらいますと,
昔貧乏人で今お金持の子供等は大笑いをして
云うには,
「あらおかしや貧乏の子
あの鳥,神様の鳥は私たちの
金の小矢でもお取りにならないものを,お前の様な
貧乏な子のただの矢腐れ木の矢を
あの鳥,神様の鳥がよくよく
取るだろうよ.」
と云って,貧しい子を足蹴にしたり
たたいたりします.けれども貧乏な子は
ちっとも構わず私をねらっています.
私はそのさまを見ると,大層不憫に思いました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながらゆっくりと大空に
私は輪をえがいていました.貧乏な子は
片足を遠く立て片足を近くたてて,
下唇をグッと噛みしめて,ねらっていて
ひょうと射放しました.小さい矢は美しく飛んで
私の方へ来ました,それで私は手を
差しのべてその小さい矢を取りました.
クルクルまわりながら私は
風をきって舞い下りました.
すると,彼かの子供たちは走って
砂吹雪をたてながら競争しました.
土の上に私が落ちると一しょに,一等先に
貧乏な子がかけついて私を取りました.
すると,昔貧乏人で今は金持になってる者の
子供たちは後から走って来て
二十も三十も悪口をついて
貧乏な子を押したりたたいたり
「にくらしい子,貧乏人の子
私たちが先にしようとする事を先がけしやがって.」
と云うと,貧乏な子は,私の上に
おおいかぶさって,自分の腹にしっかりと私を押えていました.
もがいてもがいてやっとの事,人の隙から
飛び出しますと,それから,どんどんかけ出しました.
昔は貧乏人で今は金持の子供等が
石や木片を投げつけるけれど
貧乏な子はちっとも構わず
砂吹雪をたてながらかけて来て一軒の小屋の
表へ着きました.子供は
第一の窗から私を入れて,それに
言葉を添え,斯々かくかくのありさまを物語りました.
家の中から老夫婦が
眼の上に手をかざしながらやって来て
見ると,大へんな貧乏人ではあるけれども
紳士らしい淑女らしい品をそなえています,
私を見ると,腰の央なかをギックリ屈めて,ビックリしました.
老人はキチンと帯をしめ直して,
私を拝し
「ふくろうの神様,大神様,
貧しい私たちの粗末な家へ
お出で下さいました事,有難う御座います.
昔は,お金持に自分を数え入れるほどの者で
御座いましたが今はもうこの様に
つまらない貧乏人になりまして,国の神様
大神様をお泊め申すも
畏れ多い事ながら今日はもう
日も暮れましたから,今宵は大神様を
お泊め申し上げ,明日は,ただイナウだけでも
大神様をお送り申し上げましょう.」という事を
申しながら何遍も何遍も礼拝を重ねました.
老婦人は,東の窗の下に
敷物をしいて私をそこへ置きました.
それからみんな寝ると直ぐに高いびきで
寝入ってしまいました.
私は私の体の耳と耳の間に坐って
いましたがやがて,ちょうど,真夜中時分に
起き上りました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌を静かにうたいながら
この家の左の座へ右の座へ
美しい音をたてて飛びました.
私が羽ばたきをすると,私のまわりに
美しい宝物,神の宝物が美しい音をたてて
落ち散りました.
一寸のうちに,この小さい家を,りっぱな宝物
神の宝物で一ぱいにしました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌をうたいながらこの小さい家を
一寸の間にかねの家,大きな家に
作りかえてしまいました,家の中は,りっぱな宝物の積場
を作り,りっぱな着物の美しいのを
早つくりして家の中を飾りつけました.
富豪の家よりももっとりっぱにこの大きな家の
中を飾りつけました.私はそれを終ると
もとのままに私の冑の
耳と耳の間に坐っていました.
家の人たちに夢を見せて
アイヌのニシパが運が悪くて貧乏人になって
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている者たちに
ばかにされたりいじめられたりしてるさまを私が見て
不憫に思ったので,私は身分の卑しいただの神では
ないのだが,人間の家
に泊って,恵んでやったのだという事を
知らせました.
それが済んで少したって夜が明けますと
家の人々が一しょに起きて
目をこすりこすり家の中を見るとみんな
床の上に腰を抜かしてしまいました.老婦人は
声を上げて泣き,老人は
大粒の涙をポロポロこぼして
いましたが,やがて,老人は起き上り
私の処へ来て,二十も三十も礼拝
を重ねて,そして云う事には,
「ただの夢ただの眠りをしたのだと
思ったのに,ほんとうに,こうしていただいた事.
つまらないつまらない,私共の粗末な家に
お出で下さるだけでも有難く存じますものを
国の神様,大神様,私たちの不運な
事を哀れんで下さいまして
お恵みのうちにも最も大きいお恵みをいただき
ました事.」と云う事を泣きながら
申しました.
それから,老人はイナウの木をきり
りっぱなイナウを美しく作って私を飾りました.
老婦人は身仕度をして
小さい子を手伝わせ,薪をとったり
水を汲んだりして,酒を造る仕度をして,一寸の間に
六つの酒樽を上座にならべました.
それから私は火の老女,老女神と
種々な神の話を語り合いました.
二日程たつと,神様の好物ですから
はや,家の中に酒の香が
漂いました.
そこで,あの小さい子に態わざと
古い衣物を着せて,村中の
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々を
招待するため使いに出してやりました.ので
後見送ると,子供は家毎に
入って使いの口上を述べますと
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々は
大笑いをして
「これはふしぎ,貧乏人どもが
どんな酒を造ってどんな
御馳走があってそのため人を招待するのだろう,
行ってどんな事があるか見物して
笑ってやりましょう.」と
言い合いながら大勢打ち連れて
やって来て,ずーっと遠くから,ただ家を見ただけで
驚いてはずかしがり,そのまま帰る者もあります,
家の前まで来て腰を抜かしているのもあります.
すると,家の夫人が外へ出て
人皆の手を取って家へ入れますと,
みんないざり這いよって
顔を上げる者もありません.
すると,家の主人は起き上って
カッコウ鳥の様な美しい声で物を言いました.
斯々かくかくの訳を物語り
「この様に,貧乏人でへだてなく
互に往来も出来なかったのだが
大神様があわれんで下され,何の悪い考えも
私どもは持っていませんのでしたのでこの様に
お恵みをいただきましたのですから
今から村中,私共は一族の者
なんですから,仲善くして
互に往来をしたいという事を皆様に
望む次第であります.」という事を
申し述べると,人々は
何度も何度も手をすりあわせて
家の主人に罪を謝し,これからは
仲よくする事を話し合いました.
私もみんなに拝されました.
それが済むと,人はみな,心が柔らいで
盛んな酒宴を開きました.
私は,火の神様や家の神様や
御幣ごへい棚の神様と話し合いながら
人間たちの舞を舞ったり躍りをしたりするさまを
眺めて深く興がりました.そして
二日三日たつと酒宴は終りました.
人間たちが仲の善いありさまを
見て,私は安心をして
火の神,家の神
御幣棚の神に別れを告げました.
それが済むと私は自分の家へ帰りました.
私の来る前に,私の家は美しい御幣
美酒が一ぱいになっていました.
それで近い神,遠い神に
使者をたてて招待し,盛んな酒宴を
張りました,席上,神様たちへ
私は物語り,人間の村を訪問した時の
その村の状況,その出来事を詳しく話しますと
神様たちは大そう私をほめたてました.
神様たちが帰る時に美しい御幣を
二つやり三つやりしました.
彼かのアイヌ村の方を見ると,
今はもう平穏で,人間たちは
みんな仲よく,彼のニシパが
村に頭になっています,
彼の子供は,今はもう,成人
して,妻ももち子も持って
父や母に孝行をしています,
何時でも何時でも,酒を造った時は
酒宴のはじめに,御幣やお酒を私に送ってよこします.
私も人間たちの後に坐して
何時でも
人間の国を守護まもっています.
と,ふくろうの神様が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
The Owl God's Own Song:
"Silver drops fall, fall around me."

Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I descended along the river, passing over a human village. Looking down, I saw the poor of old had become rich, and the rich of old had become poor.
On the beach, human children played with toy bows and arrows.
Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," as I passed over the children, they ran beneath me, saying,
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Come, shoot the bird with arrows!
The one who hits the god's bird first is the true hero, the true strong one!"
As they spoke, the children of those who were once poor but now rich nocked golden arrows to golden bows and shot at me, the golden arrows passing above and below me.
Among them, one child stood with a simple wooden bow and arrow, joining the group. Seeing him, I knew he was the child of a poor man, even from his clothes. But looking closely at his eyes, I saw he was likely descended from great people, a unique soul among them. He, too, nocked a simple arrow to his simple bow and aimed at me.
The children of those who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,
"How funny, the poor child!
That bird, that god's bird, won't even take notice of our golden arrows. Why would it ever take the arrow of a poor child, a rotten wooden arrow?"
They kicked and hit the poor child. But the poor child paid no mind, still aiming at me.
Seeing this, I felt great pity.
Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I slowly drew circles in the sky. The poor child stood with one foot forward and one back, biting his lower lip, aiming, and then he let fly. The small arrow flew beautifully towards me, and I reached out my hand and caught it.
Spinning around and around, I cut through the wind and descended.
The children ran, kicking up a sandstorm as they raced. As I landed on the ground, the poor child was the first to reach me and take hold of me.
Then, the children of those who were once poor but now rich ran up, hurling insults, pushing and hitting the poor child.
"Hateful child, poor child!
You took what we were going to do first!"
The poor child covered me, pressing me tightly against his belly. Struggling and struggling, he finally broke free from the crowd and ran.
The children of those who were once poor but now rich threw stones and pieces of wood, but the poor child paid no mind, running through the sandstorm until he reached a small hut.
The child put me through the first window, adding words, telling the story of what had happened.
From inside the house, an old couple came, shading their eyes with their hands. Though they were very poor, they possessed the grace of a gentleman and a lady.
Seeing me, they bent deeply at the waist, surprised. The old man straightened his belt and bowed to me.
"Owl God, Great God,
Thank you for coming to our humble home.
We were once wealthy enough to count ourselves among the rich, but now we are mere paupers. It is presumptuous to host a god, a great god, but as the day is already done, we shall host you tonight, and tomorrow we shall send you off with only *inau*."
He repeated his reverence many times.
The old woman laid a mat beneath the east window and placed me there. Then, everyone went to sleep and soon began to snore loudly.
I sat between the ears on my head, but soon, around midnight, I awoke.
Singing softly, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I flew with a beautiful sound from the left side of the house to the right.
As I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, god's treasures, fell around me with a beautiful sound.
In an instant, I filled the small house with magnificent treasures, god's treasures.
Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I transformed the small house into a house of gold, a large house, in an instant. Inside, I created a storehouse of magnificent treasures and quickly made beautiful, splendid clothes to decorate the house.
I decorated the inside of this large house even more splendidly than a wealthy man's home. When I finished, I sat between the ears on my helmet as before.
I showed the people in a dream how the Ainu *nispa* had been unlucky and become poor, and how I had seen him being scorned and bullied by those who were once poor but now rich, and I felt pity. So, though I am not a god of high status, I stayed in a human house and bestowed blessings.
After that, as dawn approached, the people of the house woke up together. Rubbing their eyes, they looked around the house and all collapsed onto the floor. The old woman cried out, and the old man shed large tears, but soon the old man got up and came to me, bowing twenty or thirty times, and then said,
"We thought it was just a dream, just sleep, but it really happened. It is too much, too much. We are grateful just for you to come to our humble home, but you, god of the land, great god, have pitied our misfortune and given us the greatest of blessings."
He said this while crying.
Then, the old man cut down an *inau* tree and made a splendid *inau* to decorate me. The old woman dressed and had the small child help her gather firewood and draw water, preparing to make sake. In an instant, she lined up six sake barrels in the upper seat.
Then I spoke with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various other gods.
After two days, the scent of sake filled the house, as it is a favorite of the gods.
So, they deliberately dressed the small child in old clothes and sent him out to invite the people in the village who were once poor but now rich. Seeing him off, the child went to each house and delivered the message. The people who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,
"This is strange. What kind of sake and what kind of feast could poor people make that they would invite people for? Let's go see what's going on and laugh at them!"
They came in a large group, and some were so surprised and ashamed just by looking at the house from afar that they went home. Some came to the front of the house and collapsed.
Then, the woman of the house came out and took everyone's hand, inviting them into the house. Everyone crawled in, unable to raise their faces.
Then, the master of the house stood up and spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird.
He told the story of what had happened.
"We were poor and unable to visit each other freely, but the great god took pity on us. We had no bad intentions, so we received these blessings. From now on, we are all members of the same family in the village, so we wish for everyone to be friendly and visit each other."
As he said this, the people rubbed their hands together many times, apologizing to the master of the house for their sins, and discussed being friendly from now on.
I was also worshiped by everyone.
When that was over, everyone's hearts softened, and they held a lively sake feast.
I spoke with the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the *gohei* shelf, watching the humans dance and sing, and I was deeply amused. And after two or three days, the sake feast ended.
Seeing the humans being friendly with each other, I felt relieved and said goodbye to the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the *gohei* shelf.
When that was over, I returned to my home. Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful *gohei* and fine sake.
So, I sent messengers to the gods near and far, inviting them to a lively sake feast. At the feast, I told the gods in detail about the situation in the human village when I visited it, and the events that occurred, and the gods praised me greatly.
When the gods left, I gave them two or three beautiful *gohei* each.
Looking towards that Ainu village, it is now peaceful, and the humans are all friendly. That *nispa* is now the head of the village.
His child is now an adult, with a wife and children, and is filial to his parents.
Whenever they make sake, they always send *gohei* and sake to me at the beginning of the feast.
I sit behind the humans and always protect the human country."
So, the owl god told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
Silver drops fall all around,
Silver drops fall all around, gold drops
fall all around. I sing this song,
flowing down the river, past the villages of men.
Looking down below,
the poor of yesterday are now rich, the rich of yesterday
are now poor.
By the sea, children play with toy bows and arrows,
laughing and shouting.
"Silver drops fall all around,
Gold drops fall all around," I sing,
flying over the children. They
run beneath me, crying out:
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Hurry, shoot the bird!
The first to hit the god's bird,
the first to claim it,
is the true hero, the true strong one!"
So say the children, once poor, now rich,
and they nock golden arrows to golden bows,
shooting at me. I let the golden arrows
pass beneath me, fly above me.
Among them,
one child stands apart, with a simple (wooden) bow,
joining the fray. I see him,
and know him for a poor child, by the clothes he wears.
Yet, looking closer, his eyes shine
with the light of great ancestors. Alone,
he joins the children. He aims his simple bow at me,
and the children, once poor, now rich, laugh and mock him,
saying:
"How foolish, poor child!
That bird, the god's bird, scorns even our
golden arrows. Why would it heed your
poor arrow, your arrow of rotten wood?
That bird, the god's bird, would never
accept your arrow!"
They kick and shove
the poor child. But he
pays them no mind, only focuses on me.
Seeing this, I feel pity.
"Silver drops fall all around,
Gold drops fall all around," I sing,
slowly
making circles in the sky. The poor child,
one foot forward, one foot back,
bites his lip, aims,
and *whoosh* the arrow flies. The small arrow flies true,
toward me, and I reach out my hand,
catching the small shaft.
I spin,
cutting the wind, and descend gracefully.
The children run,
raising dust, scrambling and shouting.
As I touch the ground, the first
to reach me is the poor child.
Then, the children, once poor, now rich,
run up from behind,
shouting insults,
pushing and shoving the poor child,
"Wretched child, child of poverty!
How dare you take what is ours!"
The poor child,
clutches me tightly, pressing me to his chest.
Struggling, he breaks free from the crowd,
and runs away.
The children, once poor, now rich,
throw stones and sticks after him,
but the poor child pays them no mind,
raising dust as he runs to a small hut.
The child
places me through the first window, and
tells the whole story,
embellishing it,
to those inside.
The old couple inside,
shield their eyes, and come out,
and though they are poor,
they have the air of gentlefolk.
Seeing me, they bow deeply,
stunned.
The old man straightens his belt,
and bows to me,
"Owl God, Great God,
we thank you for coming to our humble home.
Once, we were among the wealthy,
but now we are brought low.
To have the god of the land, a Great God,
stay with us, fills us with unease, but as
the day is late, Great God,
rest here tonight, and tomorrow, we will see you off
with *inaw*."
He bows again and again.
The old woman spreads a mat
beneath the east window, and places me there.
Then all sleep, and soon loud snores fill the air.
I sit within my form, between my ears,
and near midnight,
I rise.
"Silver drops fall all around,
Gold drops fall all around."
I sing softly,
and fly around the left and right
of this house, making beautiful sounds.
As I beat my wings, around me
beautiful treasures, god's treasures, ring out,
scattering.
In an instant, I transform this hut into a place filled with glittering treasures,
treasures of the gods.
"Silver drops fall all around,
Gold drops fall all around."
I sing, and transform this hut,
in an instant, into a golden, shining house, a great house,
and within it, I build a magnificent storehouse of treasures,
and swiftly create magnificent clothes,
adorn the house.
I decorate this great house more splendidly than the home of any rich man.
When this is done, I return to my place,
sitting upon my helmet,
between my ears.
I give this family a dream,
so they will know that because I saw the Ainu *niskipa* brought low, made poor,
mocked and bullied by those once poor, now rich, and felt pity,
I, though humble, not a great god,
have stayed in their home,
giving them blessings.
When this is done, after a time, dawn breaks,
and the family rises together,
rubbing their eyes, looking around the house, and all
fall to the ground in shock. The old woman
weeps aloud, and the old man
sheds great tears,
and soon, the old man rises,
comes before me, bows twenty or thirty times,
and says:
"We thought it was only a dream,
but it is real. That you would visit
our humble home is more than we could ever ask,
god of the land, Great God, you have pitied
our misfortune,
granting us the greatest blessing."
He weeps as he speaks.
Then, the old man cuts wood for *inaw*,
making magnificent *inaw*, and decorates me.
The old woman dresses,
and has the child help her gather firewood,
fetch water, and prepare to brew sake, and in an instant,
six barrels of sake are placed in the best seats.
Then, I speak with the old woman of fire, the old goddess,
telling stories of the gods.
After two days or so, because the gods love it,
the house is filled with
the scent of sake.
Then, they dress the child
in old clothes, and send him as a messenger,
to invite those in the village,
once poor, now rich.
Watching him leave, the child goes from house to house,
explaining his purpose,
and those once poor, now rich,
laugh aloud,
"How strange, that the poor
can brew sake, have
delicious food, and invite others?
Let us go see what is so funny."
So they say, and come in a crowd,
and from afar, seeing only the house,
they are shocked and ashamed, and turn back,
and some come to the house, and fall to the ground in shock.
Then, the woman of the house goes outside,
taking each person by the hand, and invites them in,
and all crawl forward,
not daring to raise their heads.
Then, the master of the house rises,
and speaks with a voice as beautiful as the cuckoo.
He explains the reason for all that has happened,
"Like this, because of poverty, we could not
visit each other,
and the Great God pitied us. We have no ill will,
and so we have received this blessing.
From this day forward, all in the village, we are one family,
and we hope that all will live in harmony,
visiting each other."
When he has finished, the people
rub their hands together again and again,
and apologize to the master of the house, and discuss
living in harmony from now on.
And I accept their worship.
When this is done, the hearts of the people grow soft,
and a great feast is held.
I laugh and talk with the god of fire, the god of the house,
the god of the sacred shelf,
watching the people dance and sing,
and I am very happy. Then,
after two or three days, the feast ends.
Seeing the people living in harmony,
I feel at peace,
and bid farewell to the god of fire, the god of the house,
the god of the sacred shelf.
When this is done, I return to my home.
Before I return, my home is already filled with beautiful *inaw*,
and fine sake.
Then, I send messengers
to invite the gods near and far, and hold a great feast.
At the feast, I tell the gods
in detail of my visit to the village of men,
the state of the village, and all that happened,
and the gods praise me greatly.
When the gods leave, I give them beautiful *inaw*,
two to some, three to others.
Looking at that Ainu village,
it is now at peace, and the people
live in harmony, and that *niskipa*
has become the leader of the village,
and his child, now grown,
has taken a wife and had children,
and honors his parents,
and whenever, wherever, when brewing sake,
he always sends me *inaw* and sake at the start of the feast.
And I sit behind the people,
watching over
the land of men.
So speaks the Owl God.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is accurate and clear, but it lacks some of the poetic flow and rhythmic quality of the original chant. It is a solid, understandable translation, but it reads more like a narrative than a song.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is more poetic and captures the feeling of a chant. It uses more evocative language and maintains a better flow. However, some phrases could be slightly more precise in conveying the original meaning.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 captures the poetic and rhythmic essence of the original Ainu chant more effectively than Translation 1. While both translations accurately convey the meaning, Translation 2 uses more evocative language and maintains a better flow, making it more engaging and closer to the spirit of a sung narrative. The use of repetition and slightly less formal phrasing also contributes to its chant-like quality.

The Owl God's Own Song:
Silver drops fall around,
Silver drops fall around, gold drops
fall around. I sing this song,
flowing down the river, past the villages of men.
Looking down below,
the poor of yesterday are now rich, the rich of yesterday
are now poor.
By the sea, children play with toy bows and arrows,
laughing and shouting.
"Silver drops fall around,
Gold drops fall around," I sing,
flying over the children. They
run beneath me, crying out:
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Hurry, shoot the bird!
The first to hit the god's bird,
the first to claim it,
is the true hero, the true strong one!"
So say the children, once poor, now rich,
and they nock golden arrows to golden bows,
shooting at me. I let the golden arrows
pass beneath me, fly above me.
Among them,
one child stands apart, with a simple wooden bow,
joining the fray. I see him,
and know him for a poor child, by the clothes he wears.
Yet, looking closer, his eyes shine
with the light of great ancestors. Alone,
he joins the children. He aims his simple bow at me,
and the children, once poor, now rich, laugh and mock him,
saying:
"How foolish, poor child!
That bird, the god's bird, scorns even our
golden arrows. Why would it heed your
poor arrow, your arrow of rotten wood?
That bird, the god's bird, would never
accept your arrow!"
They kick and shove
the poor child. But he
pays them no mind, only focuses on me.
Seeing this, I feel great pity.
"Silver drops fall around,
Gold drops fall around," I sing,
slowly
making circles in the sky. The poor child,
one foot forward, one foot back,
bites his lip, aims,
and *whoosh* the arrow flies. The small arrow flies true,
toward me, and I reach out my hand,
catching the small shaft.
Spinning around and around, I cut through the wind, and descend gracefully.
The children run,
raising a sandstorm, scrambling and shouting.
As I touch the ground, the first
to reach me is the poor child.
Then, the children, once poor, now rich,
run up from behind,
hurling insults,
pushing and shoving the poor child,
"Wretched child, child of poverty!
You took what is ours!"
The poor child,
clutches me tightly, pressing me to his chest.
Struggling, he breaks free from the crowd,
and runs away.
The children, once poor, now rich,
throw stones and sticks after him,
but the poor child pays them no mind,
raising a sandstorm as he runs to a small hut.
The child
places me through the first window, and
tells the whole story,
adding words, telling the story of what had happened,
to those inside.
The old couple inside,
shield their eyes, and come out,
and though they are poor,
they have the air of gentlefolk.
Seeing me, they bow deeply,
stunned.
The old man straightens his belt,
and bows to me,
"Owl God, Great God,
we thank you for coming to our humble home.
Once, we were among the wealthy,
but now we are brought low.
To have the god of the land, a Great God,
stay with us, fills us with unease, but as
the day is late, Great God,
rest here tonight, and tomorrow, we will see you off
with *inau*."
He bows again and again.
The old woman spreads a mat
beneath the east window, and places me there.
Then all sleep, and soon loud snores fill the air.
I sit within my form, between my ears,
and near midnight,
I rise.
"Silver drops fall around,
Gold drops fall around."
I sing softly,
and fly around the left and right
of this house, making beautiful sounds.
As I beat my wings, around me
beautiful treasures, god's treasures, ring out,
scattering.
In an instant, I transform this hut into a place filled with glittering treasures,
treasures of the gods.
"Silver drops fall around,
Gold drops fall around."
I sing, and transform this hut,
in an instant, into a golden, shining house, a great house,
and within it, I build a magnificent storehouse of treasures,
and swiftly create magnificent clothes,
adorn the house.
I decorate this great house more splendidly than the home of any rich man.
When this is done, I return to my place,
sitting upon my helmet,
between my ears.
I give this family a dream,
so they will know that because I saw the Ainu *nispa* brought low, made poor,
mocked and bullied by those once poor, now rich, and felt pity,
I, though humble, not a great god,
have stayed in their home,
giving them blessings.
When this is done, after a time, dawn breaks,
and the family rises together,
rubbing their eyes, looking around the house, and all
fall to the ground in shock. The old woman
weeps aloud, and the old man
sheds great tears,
and soon, the old man rises,
comes before me, bows twenty or thirty times,
and says:
"We thought it was only a dream,
but it is real. That you would visit
our humble home is more than we could ever ask,
god of the land, Great God, you have pitied
our misfortune,
granting us the greatest blessing."
He weeps as he speaks.
Then, the old man cuts wood for *inau*,
making magnificent *inau*, and decorates me.
The old woman dresses,
and has the child help her gather firewood,
fetch water, and prepare to brew sake, and in an instant,
six barrels of sake are placed in the best seats.
Then, I speak with the old woman of fire, the old goddess,
telling stories of the gods.
After two days or so, because the gods love it,
the house is filled with
the scent of sake.
Then, they dress the child
in old clothes, and send him as a messenger,
to invite those in the village,
once poor, now rich.
Watching him leave, the child goes from house to house,
explaining his purpose,
and those once poor, now rich,
laugh aloud,
"How strange, that the poor
can brew sake, have
delicious food, and invite others?
Let us go see what is so funny."
So they say, and come in a crowd,
and from afar, seeing only the house,
they are shocked and ashamed, and turn back,
and some come to the house, and fall to the ground in shock.
Then, the woman of the house goes outside,
taking each person by the hand, and invites them in,
and all crawl forward,
not daring to raise their heads.
Then, the master of the house rises,
and speaks with a voice as beautiful as the cuckoo.
He explains the reason for all that has happened,
"Like this, because of poverty, we could not
visit each other,
and the Great God pitied us. We have no ill will,
and so we have received this blessing.
From this day forward, all in the village, we are one family,
and we hope that all will live in harmony,
visiting each other."
When he has finished, the people
rub their hands together again and again,
and apologize to the master of the house, and discuss
living in harmony from now on.
And I accept their worship.
When this is done, the hearts of the people grow soft,
and a great feast is held.
I laugh and talk with the god of fire, the god of the house,
the god of the sacred shelf,
watching the people dance and sing,
and I am very happy. Then,
after two or three days, the feast ends.
Seeing the people living in harmony,
I feel at peace,
and bid farewell to the god of fire, the god of the house,
the god of the sacred shelf.
When this is done, I return to my home.
Before I return, my home is already filled with beautiful *inau*,
and fine sake.
Then, I send messengers
to invite the gods near and far, and hold a great feast.
At the feast, I tell the gods
in detail of my visit to the village of men,
the state of the village, and all that happened,
and the gods praise me greatly.
When the gods leave, I give them beautiful *inau*,
two to some, three to others.
Looking at that Ainu village,
it is now at peace, and the people
live in harmony, and that *nispa*
has become the leader of the village,
and his child, now grown,
has taken a wife and had children,
and honors his parents,
and whenever, wherever, when brewing sake,
he always sends me *inau* and sake at the start of the feast.
And I sit behind the people,
watching over
the land of men.
So speaks the Owl God.
