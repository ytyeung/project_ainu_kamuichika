梟の神の自ら歌った謡
「銀の滴しずく降る降るまわりに」

「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,金の滴
降る降るまわりに.」という歌を私は歌いながら
流に沿って下り,人間の村の上を
通りながら下を眺めると
昔の貧乏人が今お金持になっていて,昔のお金持が
今の貧乏人になっている様です.
海辺に人間の子供たちがおもちゃの小弓に
おもちゃの小矢をもってあそんで居ります.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながら子供等の上を
通りますと,(子供等は)私の下を走りながら
云うことには,
「美しい鳥! 神様の鳥!
さあ,矢を射てあの鳥
神様の鳥を射当てたものは,一ばんさきに取った者は
ほんとうの勇者,ほんとうの強者だぞ.」
云いながら,昔貧乏人で今お金持になってる者の
子供等は,金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえて私を射ますと,金の小矢を
私は下を通したり上を通したりしました.
その中に,子供等の中に
一人の子供がただの(木製の)小弓にただの小矢
を持って仲間にはいっています.私はそれを見ると
貧乏人の子らしく,着物でも
それがわかります.けれどもその眼色を
よく見ると,えらい人の子孫らしく,一人変り
者になって仲間入りをしています.自分もただの小弓に
ただの小矢を番えて私をねらいますと,
昔貧乏人で今お金持の子供等は大笑いをして
云うには,
「あらおかしや貧乏の子
あの鳥,神様の鳥は私たちの
金の小矢でもお取りにならないものを,お前の様な
貧乏な子のただの矢腐れ木の矢を
あの鳥,神様の鳥がよくよく
取るだろうよ.」
と云って,貧しい子を足蹴にしたり
たたいたりします.けれども貧乏な子は
ちっとも構わず私をねらっています.
私はそのさまを見ると,大層不憫に思いました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながらゆっくりと大空に
私は輪をえがいていました.貧乏な子は
片足を遠く立て片足を近くたてて,
下唇をグッと噛みしめて,ねらっていて
ひょうと射放しました.小さい矢は美しく飛んで
私の方へ来ました,それで私は手を
差しのべてその小さい矢を取りました.
クルクルまわりながら私は
風をきって舞い下りました.
すると,彼かの子供たちは走って
砂吹雪をたてながら競争しました.
土の上に私が落ちると一しょに,一等先に
貧乏な子がかけついて私を取りました.
すると,昔貧乏人で今は金持になってる者の
子供たちは後から走って来て
二十も三十も悪口をついて
貧乏な子を押したりたたいたり
「にくらしい子,貧乏人の子
私たちが先にしようとする事を先がけしやがって.」
と云うと,貧乏な子は,私の上に
おおいかぶさって,自分の腹にしっかりと私を押えていました.
もがいてもがいてやっとの事,人の隙から
飛び出しますと,それから,どんどんかけ出しました.
昔は貧乏人で今は金持の子供等が
石や木片を投げつけるけれど
貧乏な子はちっとも構わず
砂吹雪をたてながらかけて来て一軒の小屋の
表へ着きました.子供は
第一の窗から私を入れて,それに
言葉を添え,斯々かくかくのありさまを物語りました.
家の中から老夫婦が
眼の上に手をかざしながらやって来て
見ると,大へんな貧乏人ではあるけれども
紳士らしい淑女らしい品をそなえています,
私を見ると,腰の央なかをギックリ屈めて,ビックリしました.
老人はキチンと帯をしめ直して,
私を拝し
「ふくろうの神様,大神様,
貧しい私たちの粗末な家へ
お出で下さいました事,有難う御座います.
昔は,お金持に自分を数え入れるほどの者で
御座いましたが今はもうこの様に
つまらない貧乏人になりまして,国の神様
大神様をお泊め申すも
畏れ多い事ながら今日はもう
日も暮れましたから,今宵は大神様を
お泊め申し上げ,明日は,ただイナウだけでも
大神様をお送り申し上げましょう.」という事を
申しながら何遍も何遍も礼拝を重ねました.
老婦人は,東の窗の下に
敷物をしいて私をそこへ置きました.
それからみんな寝ると直ぐに高いびきで
寝入ってしまいました.
私は私の体の耳と耳の間に坐って
いましたがやがて,ちょうど,真夜中時分に
起き上りました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌を静かにうたいながら
この家の左の座へ右の座へ
美しい音をたてて飛びました.
私が羽ばたきをすると,私のまわりに
美しい宝物,神の宝物が美しい音をたてて
落ち散りました.
一寸のうちに,この小さい家を,りっぱな宝物
神の宝物で一ぱいにしました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌をうたいながらこの小さい家を
一寸の間にかねの家,大きな家に
作りかえてしまいました,家の中は,りっぱな宝物の積場
を作り,りっぱな着物の美しいのを
早つくりして家の中を飾りつけました.
富豪の家よりももっとりっぱにこの大きな家の
中を飾りつけました.私はそれを終ると
もとのままに私の冑の
耳と耳の間に坐っていました.
家の人たちに夢を見せて
アイヌのニシパが運が悪くて貧乏人になって
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている者たちに
ばかにされたりいじめられたりしてるさまを私が見て
不憫に思ったので,私は身分の卑しいただの神では
ないのだが,人間の家
に泊って,恵んでやったのだという事を
知らせました.
それが済んで少したって夜が明けますと
家の人々が一しょに起きて
目をこすりこすり家の中を見るとみんな
床の上に腰を抜かしてしまいました.老婦人は
声を上げて泣き,老人は
大粒の涙をポロポロこぼして
いましたが,やがて,老人は起き上り
私の処へ来て,二十も三十も礼拝
を重ねて,そして云う事には,
「ただの夢ただの眠りをしたのだと
思ったのに,ほんとうに,こうしていただいた事.
つまらないつまらない,私共の粗末な家に
お出で下さるだけでも有難く存じますものを
国の神様,大神様,私たちの不運な
事を哀れんで下さいまして
お恵みのうちにも最も大きいお恵みをいただき
ました事.」と云う事を泣きながら
申しました.
それから,老人はイナウの木をきり
りっぱなイナウを美しく作って私を飾りました.
老婦人は身仕度をして
小さい子を手伝わせ,薪をとったり
水を汲んだりして,酒を造る仕度をして,一寸の間に
六つの酒樽を上座にならべました.
それから私は火の老女,老女神と
種々な神の話を語り合いました.
二日程たつと,神様の好物ですから
はや,家の中に酒の香が
漂いました.
そこで,あの小さい子に態わざと
古い衣物を着せて,村中の
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々を
招待するため使いに出してやりました.ので
後見送ると,子供は家毎に
入って使いの口上を述べますと
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々は
大笑いをして
「これはふしぎ,貧乏人どもが
どんな酒を造ってどんな
御馳走があってそのため人を招待するのだろう,
行ってどんな事があるか見物して
笑ってやりましょう.」と
言い合いながら大勢打ち連れて
やって来て,ずーっと遠くから,ただ家を見ただけで
驚いてはずかしがり,そのまま帰る者もあります,
家の前まで来て腰を抜かしているのもあります.
すると,家の夫人が外へ出て
人皆の手を取って家へ入れますと,
みんないざり這いよって
顔を上げる者もありません.
すると,家の主人は起き上って
カッコウ鳥の様な美しい声で物を言いました.
斯々かくかくの訳を物語り
「この様に,貧乏人でへだてなく
互に往来も出来なかったのだが
大神様があわれんで下され,何の悪い考えも
私どもは持っていませんのでしたのでこの様に
お恵みをいただきましたのですから
今から村中,私共は一族の者
なんですから,仲善くして
互に往来をしたいという事を皆様に
望む次第であります.」という事を
申し述べると,人々は
何度も何度も手をすりあわせて
家の主人に罪を謝し,これからは
仲よくする事を話し合いました.
私もみんなに拝されました.
それが済むと,人はみな,心が柔らいで
盛んな酒宴を開きました.
私は,火の神様や家の神様や
御幣ごへい棚の神様と話し合いながら
人間たちの舞を舞ったり躍りをしたりするさまを
眺めて深く興がりました.そして
二日三日たつと酒宴は終りました.
人間たちが仲の善いありさまを
見て,私は安心をして
火の神,家の神
御幣棚の神に別れを告げました.
それが済むと私は自分の家へ帰りました.
私の来る前に,私の家は美しい御幣
美酒が一ぱいになっていました.
それで近い神,遠い神に
使者をたてて招待し,盛んな酒宴を
張りました,席上,神様たちへ
私は物語り,人間の村を訪問した時の
その村の状況,その出来事を詳しく話しますと
神様たちは大そう私をほめたてました.
神様たちが帰る時に美しい御幣を
二つやり三つやりしました.
彼かのアイヌ村の方を見ると,
今はもう平穏で,人間たちは
みんな仲よく,彼のニシパが
村に頭になっています,
彼の子供は,今はもう,成人
して,妻ももち子も持って
父や母に孝行をしています,
何時でも何時でも,酒を造った時は
酒宴のはじめに,御幣やお酒を私に送ってよこします.
私も人間たちの後に坐して
何時でも
人間の国を守護まもっています.
と,ふくろうの神様が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
The Owl God himself sang this song:
"Silver drops fall, fall around me."

Singing the song, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I descended along the river, passing over a human village. Looking down, I saw the poor of old now rich, and the rich of old now poor.

On the beach, human children played with toy bows and arrows. Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I passed over them. The children, running beneath me, cried out:

"A beautiful bird! A god's bird! Come, let us shoot it! The first to strike down this god's bird shall be a true hero, a true warrior!"

As they spoke, the children of those once poor, now rich, notched golden arrows into golden bows and shot at me. I dodged their golden arrows, passing above and below them.

Among them, one child stood apart, with only a simple wooden bow and arrow. I saw at once, from his clothes, that he was the child of a poor man. Yet, looking into his eyes, I saw the spirit of a noble ancestor, a singular soul among them. He notched his simple arrow and aimed at me.

The children of the once poor, now rich, laughed and jeered:

"How foolish, child of poverty! This bird, this god's bird, would never deign to be struck by our golden arrows, let alone your wretched, rotten wooden stick!"

They kicked and shoved the poor child, but he paid them no mind, focusing only on me.

Seeing this, I felt a deep pity. Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I slowly circled in the vast sky. The poor child stood with one foot forward and one back, biting his lower lip in concentration, and then, with a shout, he released his arrow. The small arrow flew true and beautiful towards me, and I reached out my hand and caught it.

Spinning and twirling, I danced down through the wind. The children ran, kicking up a storm of dust, racing to where I would fall. As I landed on the earth, the poor child reached me first and took me in his arms.

Then, the children of the once poor, now rich, ran up, showering him with insults, pushing and hitting him.

"Hateful child, child of poverty! You dared to take what we wanted first!"

The poor child, shielding me with his body, pressed me tightly to his stomach. Struggling and wriggling, he finally broke free from their grasp and ran.

The children of the once poor, now rich, threw stones and sticks, but the poor child paid them no mind, running through the dust storm until he reached a small hut. He slipped me through the first window, adding words, telling the story of what had happened.

From inside the house, an old couple came, shading their eyes with their hands. Though they were clearly poor, they possessed the bearing of a gentleman and a lady. Seeing me, they bowed deeply in surprise.

The old man straightened his belt and bowed to me, saying:

"Oh, Owl God, Great God, thank you for visiting our humble home. Once, we counted ourselves among the wealthy, but now we are reduced to this poverty. It is an honor to host a god, a great god, though we are unworthy. As night has already fallen, please stay with us this night, and tomorrow we will send you on your way with only inau."

He repeated his prayers many times. The old woman laid a mat beneath the east window and placed me there. Soon, everyone was asleep, snoring loudly.

I, sitting between the ears of my own head, awoke near midnight. Singing softly, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I flew with a beautiful sound from the left side of the house to the right.

As I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, divine treasures, fell around me with a melodious sound. In an instant, I filled the small house with magnificent treasures, divine treasures.

Singing, "Silver drops fall, fall around me, golden drops fall, fall around me," I transformed the small house into a grand mansion, a house of gold. Inside, I created a storehouse of magnificent treasures and crafted beautiful, splendid garments to adorn the house.

I decorated the grand mansion more lavishly than the home of any wealthy man. When I was finished, I returned to my place between the ears of my helmet.

I showed the family a dream, revealing that I had seen the Ainu *nissay* unfairly impoverished and scorned by those who were once poor but now rich. Feeling pity, I, though not a god of high rank, had stayed in their human home and bestowed blessings upon them.

After a while, as dawn broke, the family awoke together. Rubbing their eyes, they looked around the house and were stunned into silence. The old woman cried out, and the old man shed large tears. Finally, the old man rose and came to me, bowing twenty or thirty times, and said:

"We thought it was just a dream, just sleep, but it is truly real! We are unworthy, unworthy. It is already an honor for you to visit our humble home, but you, god of the land, great god, have pitied our misfortune and bestowed upon us the greatest of blessings!" He spoke through his tears.

Then, the old man cut inau wood and crafted beautiful, splendid inau to adorn me. The old woman prepared herself and had the small child help her gather firewood and draw water, preparing to brew sake. In an instant, she lined up six sake barrels in the upper seat.

Then, I spoke with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various other gods.

After two days, the scent of sake filled the house, as it is a favorite of the gods.

So, they deliberately dressed the small child in old clothes and sent him to invite the once poor, now rich, people of the village. As they watched him go, the child entered each house and delivered his message. The once poor, now rich, people laughed and said:

"This is strange! What kind of sake could the poor be brewing? What kind of feast could they be preparing that they would invite us? Let us go and see what is happening and have a good laugh!"

They gathered together and came, but from afar, just seeing the house, they were astonished and ashamed, and some turned back. Others came to the front of the house and were paralyzed with shock.

Then, the lady of the house came out and took each person's hand, inviting them inside. Everyone crawled in, unable to lift their faces.

Then, the master of the house rose and spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird. He told the story of what had happened.

"In this way, we were poor and unable to associate with each other without reservation, but the great god has pitied us. We have no ill intentions, and so we have received these blessings. From now on, we are all members of the same family in this village, and I hope that we can all be friendly and associate with each other."

Hearing this, the people repeatedly clasped their hands together and apologized to the master of the house, promising to be friendly from now on.

I, too, was worshipped by everyone.

When that was done, everyone's heart softened, and they held a grand feast.

I, conversing with the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the *gohei* shelf, watched the humans dance and sing, and I was deeply delighted. After two or three days, the feast came to an end.

Seeing the humans in harmony, I was relieved and bid farewell to the god of fire, the god of the house, and the god of the *gohei* shelf.

When that was done, I returned to my own home. Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful *gohei* and fine sake.

So, I sent messengers to the gods near and far, inviting them to a grand feast. At the feast, I told the gods in detail about the situation in the human village and the events that had transpired. The gods praised me greatly.

When the gods departed, I gave them two or three beautiful *gohei* each.

Looking towards that Ainu village, I saw that it was now peaceful, and the humans were all living in harmony. That *nissay* was now the head of the village.

His child had grown into adulthood, taken a wife, and had children, and was filial to his parents.

Whenever they brewed sake, they would always send *gohei* and sake to me at the beginning of the feast.

I, sitting behind the humans, always protect the human realm.

So, the Owl God told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
A song sung by the Owl God himself:

"Silver droplets, softly falling beside me."

I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling beside me, golden droplets softly falling beside me,"
Flying down the river, over human villages,
Looking down below,
The poor of yesterday are now rich, the rich of yesterday now poor.
By the sea, human children play with toy bows and arrows.
I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling beside me, golden droplets softly falling beside me,"
Flying over the children, who run beneath me, saying:
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Hurry, shoot the bird!
The first to hit the god's bird,
the first to claim it, is the true hero, the true strong one."
So, the children of those once poor, now rich, take up golden bows and golden arrows,
shooting at me. I let the golden arrows
pass beneath me, then above me.
Among those children,
one holds a simple, wooden bow and arrow,
joining the others. I see him,
like a child from a poor family, as his clothes suggest.
But looking closely at his eyes,
he seems like a descendant of greatness, standing apart,
unique among them. He too aims his simple bow and arrow at me,
and the children of those once poor, now rich, laugh loudly,
saying:
"How laughable, child of the poor!
That bird, the god's bird, scorns even our
golden arrows, so why would it care for your
common arrow, made of rotten wood?
That bird, the god's bird, would never
accept your arrow!"
Saying this, they kick and punch the poor child,
but he pays no mind, focusing only on aiming at me.
Seeing this, I feel great pity.
I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling beside me, golden droplets softly falling beside me,"
Slowly circling
in the sky. The poor child,
one foot far out, one foot close,
bites his lip, aiming,
and with a whoosh, he shoots his arrow. The small arrow flies gracefully,
toward me, and I reach out my hand,
catching the small arrow.
I spin,
tearing through the sky, dancing downwards.
Then, the children run,
raising dust, rushing forward.
As I land on the ground, the first
to arrive is the poor child, and he seizes me.
Then, the children of those once poor, now rich,
run up from behind,
scolding him with twenty, thirty words,
pushing and shoving the poor child,
"Wretched fellow, child of the poor!
Daring to get ahead of us!"
Saying this, the poor child
presses me tightly to himself, holding me close with his belly.
He struggles, struggles, finally breaking free from the crowd,
and then, he runs away quickly.
The children of those once poor, now rich,
throw stones and pieces of wood at him,
but the poor child pays no mind,
raising dust, running to a small hut.
The child
places me through the first window, and
adds words, telling what happened.
An old couple comes out of the hut,
shading their eyes with their hands,
though they are very poor,
they possess the dignity of gentlefolk.
Seeing me, they bow deeply, startled.
The old man adjusts his belt,
and worships me,
"Owl God, great god,
Thank you for coming to our poor, humble home.
Once, we were wealthy,
but now we have become such
useless poor people, to have the country's god,
great god, stay with us, is truly
unnerving, but today it is already
dark, so please, great god,
stay the night, and tomorrow, even if it's just with inao,
we will respectfully see you off."
Saying this, he bows again and again.
The old woman spreads a mat under the east window,
placing me there.
Then everyone sleeps, immediately snoring loudly,
drifting into dreams.
I sit in my body, between my ears,
and soon, around midnight,
I wake up.
I quietly sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling beside me, golden droplets softly falling beside me,"
making beautiful sounds, flying in the left and right seats of this house.
As I flap my wings, beautiful treasures,
godly treasures, scatter around me,
making beautiful sounds.
In an instant, I transform this hut into a house filled with magnificent treasures,
godly treasures.
I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling beside me, golden droplets softly falling beside me,"
In an instant, I transform this hut
into a golden, shining home, a large house,
building a magnificent treasure store inside,
quickly creating gorgeous, beautiful clothes,
decorating the house.
I decorate this large house
more splendidly than the home of the wealthy. Once finished, I
return to my place, sitting between the ears of my helmet.
I let this family dream,
letting them know that an Ainu nishpa became poor due to bad luck,
and was mocked and bullied by those once poor, now rich.
Seeing this, I felt
pity, so I am not a lowly god,
but one who dwells in human homes,
granting them blessings.
After this, a while passes, and dawn breaks,
this family wakes together,
rubbing their eyes, looking at the house, everyone
is so startled that they collapse onto the floor. The old woman
cries loudly, and the old man
sheds large, large tears.
Soon, the old man rises,
comes before me, bows twenty, thirty times,
and says:
"I thought it was just a dream, a sleep,
but to think, it was real, thank you for doing this.
Just coming to our humble home
is already a great honor,
country's god, great god, you have pitied
our misfortune,
granting us the greatest blessing."
He says, weeping.
Then, the old man cuts wood for inao,
making gorgeous, beautiful inao to decorate me.
The old woman dresses up,
and has the child help, gathering firewood,
drawing water, preparing to brew sake, and in an instant,
six barrels of sake are placed in the upper seat.
Then I discuss various godly stories with the old woman of fire, the old goddess.
After about two days, because it is something the gods love,
the house is already
filled with the aroma of sake.
Then, I intentionally have the child
wear old clothes, to invite the villagers,
those once poor, now rich,
sending him as a messenger.
Watching him leave, the child goes from house to house,
speaking the messenger's words,
and those once poor, now rich,
laugh loudly,
"How strange, what kind of sake can the poor
brew, what kind of
delicacies can they have, that they would invite people for it?
Let's go see what's so funny."
Saying this, they come in groups,
but just glancing at the house from afar,
they are surprised and ashamed, some return like that,
some come to the front of the house, collapsing to the ground in shock.
Then, the mistress of the house goes outside,
taking everyone's hand, inviting them inside,
everyone crawls in on their knees,
no one dares to raise their head.
Then, the master of the house rises,
speaking in a voice as beautiful as a cuckoo.
He tells the story,
"Like this, because of poverty, we could not honestly
interact with each other,
but the great god pitied us, we had no bad intentions,
so we received such a blessing,
from now on, the people of the village, we are all one family,
so I hope everyone can get along,
and interact with each other."
He says this, and the people
rub their hands again and again,
apologizing to the master of the house, and discussing how to
live in harmony from now on.
I also accept everyone's worship.
After this, everyone's mood softens,
and a grand banquet is held.
I laugh and talk with the fire god, the house god,
the gods of the sacred shelf,
watching the humans dance and sing,
feeling very happy. Then
two or three days pass, and the banquet ends.
Seeing the humans living in harmony,
I feel at ease,
saying goodbye to the fire god, the house god,
the gods of the sacred shelf.
After this, I return to my home.
Before I return, my home is already filled with beautiful sacred sticks and
fine sake.
So I send a messenger
to invite the nearby and distant gods, holding a grand banquet,
and at the banquet, I tell the gods
in detail about the conditions of the village and the events that occurred
when I visited the human village,
and the gods greatly praise me.
When the gods leave, I give them beautiful sacred sticks,
two or three each.
Looking again at that Ainu village,
it has now returned to peace, the humans
are all living in harmony, that nishpa
is the leader of the village,
his child, now grown,
has a wife and children,
obeying his parents,
and whenever and wherever he brews sake,
he always sends me sacred sticks and sake at the start of the banquet.
I also sit behind the humans,
constantly
guarding the human country."

The Owl God tells it this way.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4.0 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.1 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks the poetic flow and rhythm of the original Japanese text. Some of the word choices are too modern and do not reflect the traditional nature of the chant.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 maintains a better poetic flow and rhythm, closer to the original Japanese. However, some phrases are slightly awkward and could be improved for clarity. It captures the essence of a traditional Ainu chant more effectively.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 is better because it maintains a more poetic and rhythmic flow, which is crucial for a chant. While Translation 1 is understandable, it loses some of the original's lyrical quality. Translation 2 also retains more of the original's cultural context and nuances, making it a more accurate and immersive experience for the reader. The weighted score also reflects this preference.

A song sung by the Owl God himself:

"Silver droplets, softly falling around me."

I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling around me, golden droplets softly falling around me,"
Flying down the river, over human villages,
Looking down below,
The poor of yesterday are now rich, the rich of yesterday now poor.
By the sea, human children play with toy bows and arrows.
I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling around me, golden droplets softly falling around me,"
Flying over the children, who run beneath me, saying:
"A beautiful bird! A god's bird!
Hurry, shoot the bird!
The first to hit the god's bird,
the first to claim it, is the true hero, the true strong one."
So, the children of those once poor, now rich, take up golden bows and golden arrows,
shooting at me. I let the golden arrows
pass beneath me, then above me.
Among those children,
one holds a simple, wooden bow and arrow,
joining the others. I see him,
like a child from a poor family, as his clothes suggest.
But looking closely at his eyes,
he seems like a descendant of greatness, standing apart,
unique among them. He too aims his simple bow and arrow at me,
and the children of those once poor, now rich, laugh loudly,
saying:
"How laughable, child of the poor!
That bird, the god's bird, scorns even our
golden arrows, so why would it care for your
common arrow, made of rotten wood?
That bird, the god's bird, would never
accept your arrow!"
Saying this, they kick and punch the poor child,
but he pays no mind, focusing only on aiming at me.
Seeing this, I feel great pity.
I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling around me, golden droplets softly falling around me,"
Slowly circling
in the vast sky. The poor child,
one foot far out, one foot close,
bites his lip, aiming,
and with a whoosh, he shoots his arrow. The small arrow flies gracefully,
toward me, and I reach out my hand,
catching the small arrow.
I spin and twirl,
tearing through the sky, dancing downwards.
Then, the children run,
raising a storm of dust, rushing forward.
As I land on the ground, the first
to arrive is the poor child, and he seizes me.
Then, the children of those once poor, now rich,
run up from behind,
scolding him with twenty, thirty insults,
pushing and shoving the poor child,
"Wretched fellow, child of the poor!
Daring to get ahead of us!"
Saying this, the poor child
presses me tightly to himself, holding me close with his belly.
He struggles, struggles, finally breaking free from the crowd,
and then, he runs away quickly.
The children of those once poor, now rich,
throw stones and pieces of wood at him,
but the poor child pays no mind,
raising a storm of dust, running to a small hut.
The child
places me through the first window, and
adds words, telling what happened.
An old couple comes out of the hut,
shading their eyes with their hands,
though they are very poor,
they possess the dignity of gentlefolk.
Seeing me, they bow deeply, startled.
The old man adjusts his belt,
and worships me, saying:
"Oh, Owl God, great god,
Thank you for coming to our poor, humble home.
Once, we were wealthy,
but now we have become such
useless poor people, to have the country's god,
great god, stay with us, is truly
unnerving, but today it is already
dark, so please, great god,
stay the night, and tomorrow, even if it's just with inau,
we will respectfully see you off."
Saying this, he bows again and again.
The old woman spreads a mat under the east window,
placing me there.
Then everyone sleeps, immediately snoring loudly,
drifting into dreams.
I sit in my body, between my ears,
and soon, around midnight,
I wake up.
I quietly sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling around me, golden droplets softly falling around me,"
making beautiful sounds, flying in the left and right seats of this house.
As I flap my wings, beautiful treasures,
godly treasures, scatter around me,
making beautiful sounds.
In an instant, I transform this hut into a house filled with magnificent treasures,
godly treasures.
I sing the song of "Silver droplets, softly falling around me, golden droplets softly falling around me,"
In an instant, I transform this hut
into a golden, shining home, a grand mansion,
building a magnificent treasure store inside,
quickly creating gorgeous, beautiful clothes,
decorating the house.
I decorate this grand mansion
more splendidly than the home of the wealthy. Once finished, I
return to my place, sitting between the ears of my helmet.
I let this family dream,
letting them know that an Ainu *nishpa* became poor due to bad luck,
and was mocked and bullied by those once poor, now rich.
Seeing this, I felt
pity, so I am not a lowly god,
but one who dwells in human homes,
granting them blessings.
After this, a while passes, and dawn breaks,
this family wakes together,
rubbing their eyes, looking at the house, everyone
is so startled that they collapse onto the floor. The old woman
cries loudly, and the old man
sheds large, large tears.
Soon, the old man rises,
comes before me, bows twenty, thirty times,
and says:
"We thought it was just a dream, a sleep,
but to think, it was real, thank you for doing this.
Just coming to our humble home
is already a great honor,
country's god, great god, you have pitied
our misfortune,
granting us the greatest blessing."
He says, weeping.
Then, the old man cuts wood for *inao*,
making gorgeous, beautiful *inao* to decorate me.
The old woman dresses up,
and has the child help, gathering firewood,
drawing water, preparing to brew sake, and in an instant,
six barrels of sake are placed in the upper seat.
Then I discuss various godly stories with the old woman of fire, the old goddess.
After about two days, because it is something the gods love,
the house is already
filled with the aroma of sake.
Then, I intentionally have the child
wear old clothes, to invite the villagers,
those once poor, now rich,
sending him as a messenger.
Watching him leave, the child goes from house to house,
speaking the messenger's words,
and those once poor, now rich,
laugh loudly, saying:
"How strange, what kind of sake can the poor
brew, what kind of
delicacies can they have, that they would invite people for it?
Let's go see what's so funny."
Saying this, they come in groups,
but just glancing at the house from afar,
they are surprised and ashamed, some return like that,
some come to the front of the house, collapsing to the ground in shock.
Then, the mistress of the house goes outside,
taking everyone's hand, inviting them inside,
everyone crawls in on their knees,
no one dares to raise their head.
Then, the master of the house rises,
speaking in a voice as beautiful as a cuckoo.
He tells the story,
"Like this, because of poverty, we could not honestly
interact with each other,
but the great god pitied us, we had no bad intentions,
so we received such a blessing,
from now on, the people of the village, we are all one family,
so I hope everyone can get along,
and interact with each other."
He says this, and the people
rub their hands again and again,
apologizing to the master of the house, and discussing how to
live in harmony from now on.
I also accept everyone's worship.
After this, everyone's mood softens,
and a grand banquet is held.
I laugh and talk with the fire god, the house god,
the gods of the sacred shelf,
watching the humans dance and sing,
feeling very happy. Then
two or three days pass, and the banquet ends.
Seeing the humans living in harmony,
I feel at ease,
saying goodbye to the fire god, the house god,
the gods of the sacred shelf.
After this, I return to my home.
Before I return, my home is already filled with beautiful sacred sticks and
fine sake.
So I send a messenger
to invite the nearby and distant gods, holding a grand banquet,
and at the banquet, I tell the gods
in detail about the conditions of the village and the events that occurred
when I visited the human village,
and the gods greatly praise me.
When the gods leave, I give them beautiful sacred sticks,
two or three each.
Looking again at that Ainu village,
it has now returned to peace, the humans
are all living in harmony, that *nishpa*
is the leader of the village,
his child, now grown,
has a wife and children,
obeying his parents,
and whenever and wherever he brews sake,
he always sends me sacred sticks and sake at the start of the banquet.
I also sit behind the humans,
constantly
guarding the human country."

The Owl God tells it this way.
