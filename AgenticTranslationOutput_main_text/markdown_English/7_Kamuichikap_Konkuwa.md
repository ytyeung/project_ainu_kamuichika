梟の神が自ら歌った謡
         「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
昔私の物言う時は桜皮を巻いた弓の
弓把きゅうはの央を鳴り渡らす如くに
言ったのであったが,
今は衰え年老いてしまった事よ.
けれども誰か雄弁で
使者としての自信を持ってる者があったら,
天国へ五ツ半の談判
を言いつけてやりたいものだ.」と
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
私は言った,ところが入口で誰かが
「私をおいて誰が使者として雄弁で
自信のあるものがあるでしょう.」というので
見ると鴉からすの若者であった.
私は家に入れて,それから,たがつきのシントコの
蓋の上をたたきながら
鴉の若者を使者にたてる為
その談判を云いきかせて三日たって
三つ目の談判を話しながら見ると
鴉の若者は炉縁の後で
居眠りをしている,それを見ると,癪しゃくに
さわったので鴉の若者を
羽ぐるみ引っぱたいて殺してしまった.
それから又たがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら
「誰か使者として自信のある者が
あれば天国へ五ツ半の
談判を言いつけてやりたい.」と
言うと,誰かがまた入口へ
「誰が私をおいて,雄弁で
天国へ使者に立つほどの者がありましょう.」
と言うので見ると山のかけす
であった.
家へ入れてそれからまた
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の談判を話して
四日たって,四つの用向を言っているうちに
山のかけすは炉縁の後で居眠りをしている.
私は腹が立って山のかけすを羽ぐるみひっぱたいて
殺してしまった.
それからまたたがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら,
「誰か雄弁で使者として
自信のある者があれば,天国へ
五ツ半の談判を持たせてやりたい.」
と言うと,誰かが
慎つつしみ深い態度ではいって来たので見ると
川ガラスの若者,美しい様子で
左の座に坐った.それで私は
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の用件を夜でも
昼でも言い続けた.見れば
川ガラスの若者,何も疲れた様子もなく
聞いていて昼と夜を
数えて六日目に
私が言い終ると直ぐに天窗から
出て天国へ行ってしまった.
その談判の大むねは,人間の世界に
饑饉があって人間たちは今にも
餓死しようとしている.どういう訳かと
見ると天国に
鹿を司つかさどる神様と魚を司る神様とが
相談をして鹿も出さず魚も出さぬことに
したからであったので,神様たちから
どんなに言われても知らぬ顔をして
いるので人間たちは猟に
山へ行っても鹿も無い,魚漁に
川へ行っても魚も無い.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
鹿の神,魚の神へ使者をたてた
のである.
それから幾日もたって
空の方に微かな音がきこえていたが
誰かがはいって来た.見ると
川ガラスの若者,今は前よりも美しさを増し
勇ましい気品をそなえて
返し談判を述べはじめた.
天国の鹿の神や魚の神が
今日まで鹿を出さず魚を出さなかった
理由は,人間たちが鹿を捕る時に
木で鹿の頭をたたき,皮を剥ぐと
鹿の頭をそのまま山の木原に
捨ておき,魚をとると
腐れ木で魚の頭をたたいて殺すので,
鹿どもは,裸で泣きながら
鹿の神の許もとへ帰り,魚どもは
腐れ木をくわえて魚の神の
許へ帰る.鹿の神,魚の神は
怒って相談をし,鹿を出さず
魚を出さなかったのであった.がこののち
人間たちが鹿でも魚でも
ていねいに取扱うという事なら鹿も出す
魚も出すであろう,と鹿の神と
魚の神が言ったという事を詳しく申し立てた.
私はそれを聞いてから川ガラスの若者に
讃辞を呈して,見ると本当に
人間たちは鹿や魚を
粗末に取扱ったのであった.
それから,以後は,決してそんな事をしない様に
人間たちに,眠りの時,夢の中に
教えてやったら,人間たちも
悪かったという事に気が付き,それからは
幣ぬさの様に魚をとる道具を美しく作り
それで魚をとる.鹿をとったときは,鹿の頭も
きれいに飾って祭る,それで
魚たちは,よろこんで美しい御幣ごへいをくわえて
魚の神のもとに行き,鹿たちは
よろこんで新しく月代さかやきをして鹿の神
のもとに立ち帰る.それを鹿の神や
魚の神はよろこんで
沢山,魚を出し,沢山,鹿を出した.
人間たちは,今はもうなんの困る事も
ひもじい事もなく暮している,
私はそれを見て安心をした.
私は,もう年老い,衰え弱った
ので,天国へ行こうと
思っていたのだけれども,私が守護している人間の国に
饑饉があって人間たちが餓死しようとしているのに
構わずに行く事が出来ないので,
これまで居たのだけれども,今はもう
なんの気がかりも無いから,最も強い者
若い勇者を私のあとにおき人間の世を
守護させて,今天国へ行く所なのだ.
と,国の守護神なる翁神(梟)が
物語って天国へ行きました.と.

This is the English Translation 1.
"Konkuwa,
In days of old, when I spoke, it was like the twang of a cherry-bark-wrapped bow,
Resounding from the center of the *kyuha*.
But now, alas, I am weakened and aged.
Yet, if there were one eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a mission to Heaven, a negotiation of five and a half measures."
So I spoke, tapping the lid of the *shintoko* with its hoops.
Then, at the entrance, someone declared,
"Who but I is so eloquent and confident as a messenger?"
And I saw it was a young raven.
I welcomed him into my home, and then, tapping the lid of the *shintoko* with its hoops,
To appoint the young raven as my messenger,
I recounted the negotiation. Three days passed,
And as I spoke of the third point, I saw
The young raven dozing behind the hearth.
Seeing this, I was enraged,
And struck the young raven with all my feathers, killing him.
Then again, tapping the lid of the *shintoko* with its hoops,
"If there is anyone confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half measures to Heaven."
Then, someone again at the entrance said,
"Who but I is so eloquent,
So fit to stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
And I saw it was a jay from the mountains.
I welcomed him into my home, and then again,
Tapping the lid of the *shintoko* with its hoops,
I spoke of the negotiation of five and a half measures.
Four days passed, and as I spoke of the fourth matter,
The mountain jay was dozing behind the hearth.
I was angered and struck the mountain jay with all my feathers,
killing him.
Then again, tapping the lid of the *shintoko* with its hoops,
"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half measures to Heaven."
Then, someone entered with a respectful demeanor,
And I saw it was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance,
Who sat on the left side. And so I,
Tapping the lid of the *shintoko* with its hoops,
Continued to speak of the five and a half measures,
Night and day. And I saw
The young river crow, showing no sign of fatigue,
Listening, and counting the days and nights,
And on the sixth day, as soon as I finished speaking,
He emerged from the skylight and went to Heaven.
The gist of the negotiation was this: in the human world,
There was a famine, and the humans were on the verge of starvation.
And the reason for this was that in Heaven,
The god who governs the deer and the god who governs the fish
Had consulted and decided to withhold both deer and fish.
No matter what was said to them, they feigned ignorance,
So when the humans went to the mountains to hunt,
There were no deer, and when they went to the rivers to fish,
There were no fish.
I was angered by this, and so
I appointed a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.
Then, many days passed,
And a faint sound could be heard in the sky,
And someone entered. And I saw
The young river crow, now even more beautiful,
Adorned with valiant grace,
And he began to deliver the counter-negotiation.
The reason the deer god and the fish god of Heaven
Had withheld deer and fish until this day
Was that when the humans caught deer,
They struck the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,
They left the deer's head discarded in the mountain fields.
And when they caught fish,
They struck the fish's head with rotten wood to kill it.
So the deer, naked and weeping,
Returned to the deer god, and the fish,
Holding the rotten wood in their mouths, returned to the fish god.
The deer god and the fish god,
Angered, consulted and withheld deer
And fish. But if from now on
The humans treat both deer and fish
With care, then they will release deer
And fish, so the deer god and
The fish god said, he reported in detail.
Having heard this, I offered praise to the young river crow, and I saw that truly
The humans had treated deer and fish
Carelessly.
Then, from then on, so that such things would never happen again,
I taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,
And the humans realized their wrongdoings, and from then on,
They beautifully crafted tools for catching fish, like *nusa*,
And used them to catch fish. And when they caught deer, they also
Beautifully adorned and celebrated the deer's head. And so
The fish, rejoicing, held the beautiful *gohei* in their mouths
And went to the fish god, and the deer,
Rejoicing, freshly shaved their *sakayaki* and returned to the deer god.
The deer god and
The fish god, pleased with this,
Released many fish and many deer.
The humans now live without any hardship
Or hunger,
And seeing this, I was relieved.
I am now old, weakened, and frail,
And I had intended to go to Heaven,
But because there was a famine in the human land that I protect,
And the humans were on the verge of starvation, I could not
Go without concern, and so
I have remained until now, but now that there is no longer
Any worry, I will place the strongest,
A young hero, in my place to protect the human world,
And now I shall go to Heaven."
So spoke the old god (the owl), guardian of the land,
And went to Heaven.

This is the English Translation 2.
"Konkwa."
In days of old, when I spoke, my words resonated like the twang of a cherry-bark bound bow,
Echoing from the center of the bow's handle, reaching all directions.
But now, I am aged, and time urges me onward.
Yet, if there be an eloquent one,
Bearing the confidence of a messenger,
I would send them to the heavens, to negotiate the five-and-a-half matters."

So I spoke, striking the lid of the hooped *shintoko*.
Suddenly, a voice from the entrance:
"Who but I is eloquent,
Bearing the confidence of a messenger?"
I looked, and it was a young crow.
I invited him in, and again, I struck the lid of the hooped *shintoko*,
Desiring to appoint the young crow as my envoy,
I explained the matters of negotiation, diligently, for three days.
On the third day, as I recounted the third matter,
I saw the young crow dozing by the hearth.
Seeing this, my anger flared,
And I struck the young crow, feathers and all, until he died.

Then, once more, I struck the lid of the hooped *shintoko*,
"If there be a confident messenger,
I would send them to the heavens, to negotiate the five-and-a-half matters."
As I spoke, another voice from the entrance:
"Who but I is eloquent,
Sufficient to serve as a messenger to the heavens?"
I looked, and it was a mountain jay.
I invited him in, and again,
I struck the lid of the hooped *shintoko*,
Explaining the five-and-a-half matters,
For four days, and as I recounted the fourth crucial point,
The mountain jay was dozing by the hearth.
My rage was uncontrollable, and I struck the mountain jay, feathers and all, until he died.

Then, once more, I struck the lid of the hooped *shintoko*,
"If there be an eloquent one, bearing the confidence of a messenger,
I would send them to the heavens, carrying the five-and-a-half matters."
As I spoke, one entered with
A respectful demeanor. I looked,
And it was a young river otter, handsome of face,
Who sat on the left.
I then struck the lid of the hooped *shintoko*,
Repeating the five-and-a-half
Crucial matters, day and night.
But the young river otter showed no sign of weariness,
Listening intently, pressing on day and night,
Until the sixth day,
When I had finished speaking, he immediately departed through the skylight,
And journeyed to the heavens.

The crux of the negotiation was that the human world
Was plagued by famine, and the people were on the verge
Of starvation. The reason for this,
Was that the gods of the heavens,
The god of deer and the god of fish,
Had conspired to send neither deer nor fish.
No matter how earnestly the humans pleaded, the gods turned a deaf ear.
Therefore, when humans hunted
In the mountains, they found no trace of deer; when they fished
In the rivers, they found no sign of fish.
Seeing this, my anger flared,
And I sent a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

After several days,
A faint sound could be heard in the air,
And then someone entered. I looked,
And it was the young river otter, now even more
Handsome and noble than before,
Who began to recount the negotiated reply.
The deer god and the fish god of the heavens
Refused to send deer or fish
Because, when humans hunted deer,
They struck the deer's head with wood, skinned it,
And carelessly discarded the deer's head in the mountain forests.
When they caught fish,
They killed them by striking their heads with rotten wood.
Therefore, the deer, naked and weeping,
Returned to the deer god; the fish,
Mouths filled with rotten wood, returned to the fish god.
The deer god and the fish god,
Enraged, conspired to send neither deer
Nor fish. However, if in the future
Huans would treat the deer and fish with kindness,
The deer god and the fish god would send deer
And fish. The deer god and the
Fish god spoke thus, explaining everything in detail.

Hearing this, I offered praise to the young river otter,
And learned that
Humans had indeed
Been treating the deer and fish cruelly.
From that day forward, to prevent such things from happening again,
When humans slept, in their dreams
I warned them, and humans
Realized their mistakes. From then on,
They crafted their fishing and hunting tools with care, like making *nusa*,
And used them to catch fish. When they hunted deer, they also
Adorned the deer's head with care and held a festival. Therefore,
The fish joyfully carried beautiful *gohei* in their mouths,
And returned to the fish god; the deer
Joyfully groomed their *sakayaki*, and returned to the deer god.
The deer god and the
Fish god, seeing this, were greatly pleased,
And sent forth fish in abundance, and deer in abundance.
The human world now had no hardship,
Nor fear of starvation,
And seeing this, I felt at peace.

I am now old and frail,
And had intended to journey to the heavens,
But the human realm I protect
Was plagued by famine, and the people were on the verge of starvation,
And I could not abandon them,
So I have remained until now. Now I have no
Further concerns, so I wish to select the strongest,
Youngest warrior to succeed me, to protect humanity,
And I, today, shall journey to the heavens."

Thus, the guardian god of the land, the old god (owl),
Finished speaking, and journeyed to the heavens. So it is.

### Scoring

|               | Accuracy | Easy to understand | Poetic Flow | Total Score |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Translation 1 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3.9 |
| Translation 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.0 |

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Translation 1 is accurate and understandable, but at times it feels a bit literal. Some of the phrasing could be more poetic to better reflect the nature of a chant.

#### Translation 2
Translation 2 is slightly more poetic and evocative. The language used is a bit more elevated, which suits the context of a divine chant. The use of 'envoy' instead of 'messenger' is a good example.

### Better Choice
Translation 2
#### Comment
Translation 2 has a slightly better poetic flow and maintains accuracy well. The word choices are more evocative, and the overall tone feels more consistent with a traditional chant. While both translations are good, Translation 2 edges out Translation 1 in terms of capturing the spirit of the original text.
