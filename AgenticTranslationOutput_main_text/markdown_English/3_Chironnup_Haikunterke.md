狐が自ら歌った謡
「ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ」

ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ
国の岬,神の岬の上に
私は坐して居りました.
ある日に外へ出て見ますと
海は凪なぎてひろびろとしていて,海の上に
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカとサマユンクルが
海猟に三人乗りで出かけています,それを見た私は
私の持ってる悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上をずーっと上へずーっと下へ
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけ出しました.
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパーウ,パウと叫び
この川の水源をにらみにらみ暴風の魔を
呼びました.すると,それにつれてこの川の
水源から烈しい風,つむじ風が
吹き出して海にはいると直ぐに
この海は,上の海が下になり
下の海が上になりました.オキキリムイたち
の漁舟は沖の人の海と,陸の人の海との
出会ったところ(海の中程)に,非常な急変に会って波の間を
クルリと廻りました.大きな浪が山の様に
舟の上へかぶさり寄ります.すると,
オキキリムイ,サマユンクル,シュプンラムカは
声をふるって,舟を漕ぎました.
この小さい舟は落葉の飛ぶ様に吹き飛ばされ
今にもくつがえりそうになるけれども
感心にも人間たちは力強くて
この小舟は風の中に
波の上をすべります.
それを見ると私の持っている悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり,
重い調子で木片がポキリポキリと折れる様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔を声援するのみに精を出しました.
そうしてる中に,やっと,サマユンクルが
手の上から,手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれました.
そのさまを見て私はひそかに笑いを浮べました.
それからまた,精を出して
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
暴風の魔を声援しました.
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカと二人で
励まし合いながら勇ましく舟を漕いで
居りましたが,と,ある時シュプンラムカは
手の上から手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれてしまいました,それを見て
ひそかに私は笑いました.
それからまた軽い足取りで腰やわらかに
飛びまわり重い調子でかたい木片を
ポキリポキリと折る様に叫び精を出しました.
けれども,オキキリムイは疲れた様子は少しも無い.
一枚の薄物を体にまとい,
舟を漕いでいます,そのうちに
手の下でその持っていた楫、が折れてしまいました.
すると,疲れ死んだサマユンクルに
躍りかかりその持っている楫、をもぎとってたった一人で
舟を漕ぎました.
私はそれを見ると,持前の悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
重い調子でかたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
精を出して暴風の魔に声援しました.
そうしてるうちにサマユンクルの舵も
折れてしまいました.オキキリムイはシュプンラムカに
躍りかかりその楫をとって
勇ましく舟を漕ぎました.
けれども彼の楫も波に折られてしまいました.
そこで,オキキリムイは舟の中に
立ちつくして,烈しい風のうちに
まさか人間の彼が私を見つけようとは
思わなかったに,国の岬,神の岬の
上の,私の眼の央を見つめました.
今までやさしかった顔に怒りの色を
あらわして,鞄をいじっていたが
中から出したものを見ると,蓬よもぎの小弓と
蓬の小矢を取り出しました.
それを見てひそかに私は笑いました.
「人間なぞ何をしたって,恐い事があるものか,
あんな蓬の小矢は何に使うものだろう.」
と思ってこの岬
国の岬,神の岬の上を
ずーっと上へずーっと下へ軽い足取りで
腰やわらかにかけまわり,重い調子で
かたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔をほめたたえました.
その中にオキキリムイの射放した矢が飛んで来ましたが
ちょうど私の襟首えりくびのところへ突きささりました.
それっきりあとどうなったか解らなくなってしまいました.
ふと気がついて見ると
大そう好いお天気で,海の上は
広々として,オキキリムイの漁舟もなにもありません.
どうした事か私の頭のさきから
足のさきまで雁皮が燃え縮む様に痛みます.
まさか人間の射た小さな矢がこんなに私を苦しめ
ようとは思わなかったのに,それから手足をもがき苦しみ
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上を,ずーっと上へ,ずーっと下へ泣き叫びながら
もがき苦しみ,昼でも夜でも生きたり
死んだり,している中に,どうしたか
わからなくなりました.
ふと気がついて見ると,
大きな黒狐の耳と耳との間に私は居りました.
二日ほどたった時,オキキリムイが神様の様な様子で
やって来て,ニコニコ笑って言うことには,
「まあ見ばのよい事,国の岬,神の岬
の上を見守る黒狐の神様は,
善い心,神の心を持っていたから
死にざまの見ばのよい死方をしたのですね.」
言いながら私の頭を取って,
自分の家へ持って行き私の上顎の骨を
自分の便所のどだいとし,私の下顎を
その妻の便所の礎として,
私のからだはそのまま土と共に腐ってしまいました.
それから夜でも昼でも
悪い臭気に苦しんでいる中に私はつまらない死方,悪い
死方をしました.
ただの身分の軽い神でもなかったのですが
大変な悪い心を私は持っていた為なんにも
ならない,悪い死方を私はしたのですから
これからの狐たちよ,決して
悪い心を持ちなさるな.

と狐の神様が物語りました.

This is the English Translation 1.
“Haikun Tekere Haikoshitemutori”

Haikun Tekere Haikoshitemutori,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat in my place.
One day, I ventured out to look,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur
Set out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this,
The wicked thoughts within me stirred.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with light steps,
I ran, my waist swaying gently.
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood,
I cried, “Pau, Pau!”
Glaring at the source of this river, I summoned
The demon of the storm. In response, from the river's
Source, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Erupted and rushed into the sea, and at once,
The upper sea became the lower, and
The lower sea the upper. Okikirmui and his companions’
Fishing boat, at the meeting place of the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land (mid-sea),
Met with a sudden change, spinning
Amidst the waves. A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed over the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka,
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown like a falling leaf,
On the verge of capsizing, yet
Admirably, the humans were strong,
And the small boat glided through the wind,
Over the waves. Seeing this,
The wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, “Pau, Pau!”
Devoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, at last, Samayunkur’s
Hands bled from above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I exerted myself,
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
With a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,
Cheering on the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka, the two of them,
Encouraging each other, bravely rowed the boat,
But then, at one moment, Shupunramka’s
Hands bled from above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps, my waist swaying gently,
I leaped about, with a heavy tone, like snapping
Hard wood, I cried, exerting myself.
Yet, Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a single thin garment wrapped around his body,
He rowed the boat, until
Under his hand, the oar he held snapped.
Then, leaping upon the exhausted Samayunkur,
He snatched the oar he held and rowed alone.
Seeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.
With a heavy tone, like snapping hard wood, I cried,
With light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,
Exerting myself to cheer on the demon of the storm.
As I did so, Samayunkur’s rudder also
Snapped. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramka,
Took his oar, and
Bravely rowed the boat.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
In the boat, amidst the fierce wind,
Never imagining that a human like him could find me,
He gazed at the center of my eyes,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His gentle face now showing anger,
He fiddled with a bag,
And from within, he took out a small mugwort bow and
A small mugwort arrow.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
“What can a human do to frighten me?
What use is such a mugwort arrow?”
Thinking this, upon this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, with light steps,
I ran, my waist swaying gently, with a heavy tone,
Like snapping hard wood, I cried, “Pau, Pau!”
Praising the demon of the storm.
In the midst of this, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
And pierced the back of my neck.
From then on, I knew nothing more.
When I came to, it was
A very fine day, the sea was
Vast, and there was no sign of Okikirmui’s fishing boat.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it ached as if birch bark was burning and shrinking.
Never imagining that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so,
I writhed in agony, flailing my limbs,
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, crying out,
Writhing in agony, living and
Dying, day and night, until I knew not
What had become of me.
When I came to, I was
Between the ears of a great black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui arrived, looking like a god,
Smiling and saying,
“How beautiful! The black fox god who watches over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Because he had a good heart, a god’s heart,
Has died a beautiful death.”
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and made my upper jawbone
The foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
The cornerstone of his wife’s toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
From then on, day and night,
Suffering from a foul stench, I died a meaningless, bad
Death.
Though I was not merely a god of low rank,
Because I had a terribly wicked heart, I died a useless,
Bad death. Therefore,
Foxes of the future, never
Hold wicked thoughts."

So the fox god told his story.

This is the English Translation 2.
"Haikunteleke Haikoshitemtori" 

Haikunteleke Haikoshitemtori
I once sat upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
One day, I emerged from my cave and gazed out,
The sea was calm, vast, and boundless.
I saw Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur,
The three of them, setting out to sea in a boat to hunt. Seeing this,
A wicked thought arose in my heart.
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I moved nimbly back and forth, my waist supple.
In a heavy voice, like the sound of breaking wood, I cried, "Pau, Pau!"
I glared at the source of the river, summoning the demon of the storm.
Then, from the river's source,
A fierce wind howled, a tornado arose,
Plunging straight into the sea, and in an instant,
The sea overturned, upside down. Okikirmui and the others'
fishing boat, at the meeting point of the near and far seas,
Encountered a sudden change, swirling in the waves.
Giant waves crashed down like mountains.
Thus, Okikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka
Shouted and rowed with all their might.
The small boat was tossed by the wind like a fallen leaf,
Nearly capsizing,
Yet the resilience of humans is admirable,
The small boat weaved through the storm.
Seeing this, the wickedness in my heart grew stronger.
I moved nimbly back and forth, my waist supple,
In a heavy voice, like the sound of breaking wood, I cried, "Pau, Pau!"
Striving to encourage the demon of the storm.
As this continued, finally, Samayunkur's
hands bled profusely,
And he collapsed, exhausted.
Seeing this tragic sight, I secretly laughed.
Afterward, I tried even harder,
Moving nimbly back and forth, my waist supple,
Crying out in a heavy voice, like the sound of breaking wood,
Encouraging the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka encouraged each other,
Rowing bravely,
However, at some point, Shupunramka's
hands bled profusely,
And he collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,
I secretly laughed.
Afterward, I once again nimbly
Leapt back and forth, crying out in a heavy voice, like the sound of breaking hard wood,
With all my strength.
However, Okikirmui showed no signs of fatigue.
Clad only in thin clothing,
He rowed with all his might, and soon,
The oar in his hands snapped.
Then, he lunged at the exhausted and dead Samayunkur,
Seizing his oar, and rowed alone.
Seeing this, the wickedness in my heart surged again.
Crying out in a heavy voice, like the sound of breaking hard wood,
Moving nimbly back and forth, my waist supple,
Striving to encourage the demon of the storm.
As this continued, Samayunkur's oar also
Snapped. Okikirmui lunged at Shupunramka,
Seizing his oar,
Rowing bravely.
However, his oar was also broken by the waves.
Then, Okikirmui stood in the boat,
In the midst of the storm,
He never expected that he, a human, would discover me,
Above the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Looking directly into my eyes.
His originally gentle face showed anger,
And he fiddled with a pouch,
Taking out from it a small wormwood bow and
A small wormwood arrow.
Seeing this, I secretly laughed.
"What is there to fear from a mere human,
And what use is that small wormwood arrow?"
So I thought, upon this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I moved nimbly back and forth,
My waist supple, in a heavy voice,
Like the sound of breaking hard wood, I cried, "Pau, Pau!"
Praising the demon of the storm.
In the meantime, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
Striking me right in the collar.
From then on, I knew nothing of what happened.
Suddenly awakened,
The weather was clear,
The sea was vast, and Okikirmui's fishing boat was nowhere to be seen.
For some reason, from the top of my head to
My toes, it ached as if Japanese paper was burning.
I never expected that a small arrow shot by a human would torment me so, I struggled,
Upon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Crying out,
Struggling, whether day or night, sometimes alive, sometimes dead,
I don't know how long it lasted.
Suddenly awakened,
I found myself between the ears of a giant black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui came like a deity,
Smiling and saying,
"What a beautiful sight, the black fox god who protects the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Because he harbored good thoughts and possessed the heart of a god,
He was able to die so peacefully."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it home, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation for his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the cornerstone for his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted with the soil.
From then on, day and night,
I was tormented by the stench, I died without value, I died miserably.
I was not a god of low status,
But because I harbored wicked thoughts, I ended up in such a
Worthless, miserable end,
Therefore, future foxes, never
Harbor wicked thoughts.

Thus spoke the Fox God.

### Comments
#### Translation 1
Pros: Accurate translation of the original meaning. Cons: Some phrases are slightly awkward and lack poetic flow. The repetition of 'cape of the land, cape of the gods' can feel redundant.

#### Translation 2
Pros: Uses more varied vocabulary and attempts to create a more dramatic tone. Cons: Occasionally sacrifices accuracy for the sake of dramatic effect. Some phrases are less literal, which can alter the original meaning slightly.

### Better Choice
Translation 1
#### Comment
Translation 1 is slightly better because it maintains a more consistent tone and rhythm throughout the poem. While both translations are generally accurate, Translation 1's word choices and sentence structure create a more engaging and poetic reading experience. The weighted score also reflects this preference, prioritizing accuracy but also considering readability and poetic flow.
