    "english_translation": "(1) This is an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a representative of humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for feasts).\n",

    "comment": "Analysis of the two translations:\n\nTranslation 1:\nPros: More literal translation of \"御幣で飾りをつけたもの\" as \"an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers)\". Explicitly defines *gohei* as \"paper streamers\".\nCons: Slightly awkward phrasing in places, such as \"acts as a representative of humans\" instead of \"acts as a proxy for humans\".\n\nTranslation 2:\nPros: More natural and fluent English. Uses \"proxy\" instead of \"representative,\" which is better.\nCons: Less literal translation of \"御幣で飾りをつけたもの\" as \"decorated with gohei\". Doesn't define *gohei*. \"Sacred sake\" is not necessarily implied in the original Japanese.\n\nChoice of Better Translation: Translation 2 is slightly better due to its more natural English and accurate conveyance of meaning. However, it misses the opportunity to define *gohei*.\n\nUpdated Translation Strategy: Combine the strengths of both translations. Use the natural language of Translation 2 while incorporating the explicit definition of *gohei* from Translation 1."
