### Prompt
```
You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of English translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two English translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into English again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern and simple English for easy understanding. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) This is an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a representative of humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for feasts).


This is the English Translation 2.
This object, decorated with gohei, is used when offering sacred sake to the gods. This kike-ush-pashui acts as a proxy for humans and is said to convey the messages that humans want to send to the gods. Ordinary chopsticks without gohei decorations are called iku pashui (chopsticks for feasts).

```

### Output
```
This is an object decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a proxy for humans and is said to convey the messages that humans want to send to the gods. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* decorations are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for feasts).

Analysis of the two translations:

Translation 1:
Pros: More literal translation of "御幣で飾りをつけたもの" as "an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers)". Explicitly defines *gohei* as "paper streamers".
Cons: Slightly awkward phrasing in places, such as "acts as a representative of humans" instead of "acts as a proxy for humans".

Translation 2:
Pros: More natural and fluent English. Uses "proxy" instead of "representative," which is better.
Cons: Less literal translation of "御幣で飾りをつけたもの" as "decorated with gohei". Doesn't define *gohei*. "Sacred sake" is not necessarily implied in the original Japanese.

Choice of Better Translation: Translation 2 is slightly better due to its more natural English and accurate conveyance of meaning. However, it misses the opportunity to define *gohei*.

Updated Translation Strategy: Combine the strengths of both translations. Use the natural language of Translation 2 while incorporating the explicit definition of *gohei* from Translation 1.
