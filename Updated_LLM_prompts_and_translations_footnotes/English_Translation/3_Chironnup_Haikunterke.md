(1) pau.狐の鳴声の擬声詞.
(2) pushtotta......鞄の様な形のもので,海猟に出かける時に火道具,薬類,その他細々の必要品を入れて持ってゆくもの.同じ用途のもので piuchiop,karop などがありますが,蒲がま,アツシ織などで作りますから,陸で使用します.pushtotta は熊の皮,あざらしの皮,その他の毛皮で製しますから水がとおらないので,海へ持って行くのです.
(3) noya ai......蓬の矢.蓬はアイヌの尊ぶ草です.蓬の矢で打たれると,浮ぶ事が出来ないから悪魔の最も恐れるものだと云うので,遠出するとき必要品の一つに数えられます.
(4) もとは男の便所と女の便所は別になっていました.ashinru も eosineru も同じく便所の事.
狐の中で黒狐は最も尊いものだとしています.海の中に突き出ている岬は大概黒狐の所領で,黒狐はよっぽどの大へんがなければ,人に声をきかせないと申します.
Okikurumi(Okikirmui)と Samayunkur と Shupunramka とはいとこ同士で,Shupunramka は一ばん年上で Okikirmui は一ばん年下だと云います.Shupunramka は温和な人で内気ですからなにも話がありませんが,Samayunkur は短気で,智恵が浅く,あわて者で,根性が悪い弱虫で,Okikirmui は神の様に智恵があり,情深く,勇気のあるえらい人だと云うので,その物語りは無限というほど沢山あります.

This is the English Translation 1.
(1) pau: Onomatopoeia for the sound of a fox's cry.

(2) pushtotta: A bag-like item used when going sea hunting, to carry fire-making tools, medicines, and other small necessities. Similar items for the same purpose include *piuchiop* and *karop*, but these are made from cattail matting (*gama*) or *attush* woven fabric, so they are used on land. *pushtotta* are made from bear skin, seal skin, or other fur, making them waterproof and suitable for taking to sea.

(3) noya ai: Arrow made of mugwort. Mugwort is a plant revered by the Ainu. It is said that demons fear being struck by a mugwort arrow because it prevents them from floating away, making it an essential item for long journeys.

(4) Originally, men's and women's toilets were separate. *ashinru* and *eosineru* both refer to toilets.

Among foxes, the black fox is considered the most revered. Capes jutting out into the sea are generally considered the territory of black foxes, and it is said that a black fox will not make its presence known to humans unless something very serious is happening.

*Okikurumi (Okikirmui)*, *Samayunkur*, and *Shupunramka* are cousins, with *Shupunramka* being the oldest and *Okikirmui* the youngest. *Shupunramka* is a gentle and timid person, so there are no stories about him. *Samayunkur* is short-tempered, lacks wisdom, is hasty, has a bad nature, and is a coward. *Okikirmui*, on the other hand, is wise like a god, compassionate, courageous, and a great person, so there are countless stories about him.


This is the English Translation 2.
(1) pau: An onomatopoeia for the sound a fox makes.
(2) pushtotta: A bag-like item used during sea hunting to store fire-making tools, medicine, and other small necessities. Similar items include piuchiop and karop, but these are made from reeds or attush and used on land. pushtotta is made from bear skin, seal skin, or other fur, making it waterproof and suitable for use at sea.
(3) noya ai: An arrow made of mugwort. Mugwort is a sacred grass to the Ainu. It is said that being shot by a mugwort arrow prevents one from floating, making it the thing that demons fear most. Therefore, it is considered an essential item for long journeys.
(4) Originally, men's and women's toilets were separate. ashinru and eosineru both mean toilet.
Among foxes, the black fox is considered the most noble. Capes protruding into the sea are often the territory of black foxes, and it is said that a black fox will not allow its voice to be heard unless something very significant is happening.
Okikurumi (Okikirmui), Samayunkur, and Shupunramka are cousins. Shupunramka is the oldest, and Okikirmui is the youngest. Shupunramka is gentle and introverted, so there are not many stories about him. Samayunkur is hot-tempered, lacks wisdom, and is reckless, cowardly, and has a bad personality. Okikirmui, on the other hand, is wise like a god, compassionate, brave, and great, so there are countless stories about him.

## Analysis of the Two Translations:

**Translation 1:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   More literal translation, preserving specific details (e.g., "cattail matting (*gama*) or *attush* woven fabric").
    *   Clearer explanation of the relationship between the cousins.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Slightly less fluent in certain areas.
    *   The phrase "making it an essential item for long journeys" is a bit redundant.

**Translation 2:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   More concise and fluent in general.
    *   Uses simpler language (e.g., "reeds" instead of "cattail matting").
*   **Cons:**
    *   Less detailed in some explanations (e.g., omits the parenthetical explanation of *gama*).
    *   The description of Samayunkur is slightly less vivid.

**Choice of Better Translation:**

Translation 1 is slightly better due to its greater accuracy and detail, which are crucial for understanding the nuances of the original text. However, Translation 2 has better flow and simpler language in some instances.

## Updated Translation Strategy:

The updated translation will primarily use Translation 1 as a base, incorporating the strengths of Translation 2 to improve fluency and readability. The goal is to maintain accuracy while making the text more accessible to a modern English-speaking audience.
