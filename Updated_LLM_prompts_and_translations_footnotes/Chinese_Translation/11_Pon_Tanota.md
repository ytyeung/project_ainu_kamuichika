### Prompt
```
You are translating the following Japanese text into Chinese. The original text is a Japanese translation of footnotes a Ainu chant. 
You have 2 versions of Chinese translations at hand.

Here are your tasks:

1. Compare the two Chinese translations with the original Japanese text. List out the Pros and Cons of the two Translations.
2. Choose a better translation. Accuracy of meaning is the most important criterion. Easy to understand is the second.
3. Based on the better translation, translate the Japanese text into Chinese again, incorporating the Pros of the two translations.

Keep the original Japanese meaning accurately. Use modern Chinese for easy understanding. Display in Traditional Chinese. 
If a term cannot be translated, keep the original language.
For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. 

This is the Japanese text.
(1) iwan poknashir......六つの地獄.地の下には六段の世界があってそこには種々な悪魔が住んでいます.

This is the Chinese Translation 1.
(1) iwan poknashir......六個地獄。地底下有六層世界,那裡住著各式各樣的惡魔。


This is the Chinese Translation 2.
iwan poknashir......六層地獄。 在地底下有六層，各種惡魔居住在那裡。

```

### Output
```
iwan poknashir......六層地獄。地底下有六層世界，各種惡魔居住在那裡。

Analysis of the two Chinese translations:

Translation 1:
Pros: More literal translation of "六つの地獄" as "六個地獄".
Cons: Slightly less natural phrasing in the second sentence.

Translation 2:
Pros: More natural and concise phrasing, especially in the second sentence.
Cons: "六つの地獄" is translated as "六層地獄", which is not a direct translation.

Choice of Better Translation: Translation 2 is better because it is more natural and easier to understand, while still maintaining the core meaning. However, the translation of "六つの地獄" can be improved.

Updated Translation Rationale: Incorporate the natural phrasing of Translation 2 while ensuring accurate translation of key terms. Use "六層地獄" to align with the concept of layered underworld.
