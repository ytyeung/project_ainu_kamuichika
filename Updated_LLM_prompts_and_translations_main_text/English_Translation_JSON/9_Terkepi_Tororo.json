    "english_translation_1": "The Frog's Own Song\n\"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!\"\n\nToro ro hanroku hanroku!\nOne day, as I hopped and played in the meadow,\nI saw a house. I went to the doorway,\nand inside, beside a pile of treasures,\nwas a raised platform. On that platform,\na young man was carving a sheath, his head bowed.\nI thought to play a trick, so I sat on the threshold\nand sang, \"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!\"\nThen, the young man raised the hand that held his knife,\nlooked at me, and smiled gently.\n\"Is that your song? Your song of joy?\nI'd like to hear more,\" he said.\nPleased, I sang again, \"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!\"\nAnd the young man said,\n\"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?\nI'd like to hear it closer.\"\nHearing this, I was delighted and hopped down\nto the hearth's edge on the lower side,\nand sang, \"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!\"\nThe young man said,\n\"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?\nI'd like to hear it closer.\"\nHearing this, I was truly happy, and hopped\nto the corner of the hearth on the upper side,\nand sang, \"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!\"\nSuddenly! The young man leaped up,\nor so I thought, and grabbed a large, burning log,\nhurling it at me! The sound was as if the world in front of me collapsed, and after that, I knew nothing.\nWhen I came to, I was at the edge of the refuse heap,\na bloated frog lay dead, and I was sitting between its ears.\nLooking closely, I realized that what I thought was a mere human's house\nwas actually the home of Okikirmui, a god of immense power.\nAnd without knowing it was Okikirmui,\nI had played a trick.\nNow, I am to die such a meaningless, wretched death.\nTherefore, frogs of the future, never,\never play tricks on humans.\"\nAnd with those words, the bloated frog died.",
    "english_translation_2": "The Frog's Self-Sung Ballad:\n\"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\n\nTororo Hanroku Hanroku!\n\"One day, as I hopped and played in the meadow,\nI spied a dwelling and went to its door to peek.\nInside, treasures piled high, beside a raised bed.\nA young man sat upon it, head bent, carving a knife sheath.\nA mischievous thought struck me, so I sat upon the threshold,\nAnd sang: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\nThe young man, hearing my voice, raised his knife-holding hand,\nLooked at me, smiled brightly, and asked:\n\"Is this your song? Your joyful tune?\nI long to hear it again.\"\nOverjoyed, I sang once more: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\nThe young man then said:\n\"Is this your yukar? Your sakehau?\nI wish to hear it closer.\"\nAt these words, my heart bloomed, and I leaped to the lower hearth's edge,\nSinging: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\nThe young man persisted:\n\"Is this your yukar? Your sakehau?\nI wish to hear it closer still.\"\nHearing this, I was beside myself with glee, and hopped to the corner of the upper hearth,\nSinging loudly: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\n\nSuddenly! The young man rose with a start,\nSwift as the wind, he seized a massive, burning log,\nAnd hurled it at me, and all went black,\nAnd I knew no more.\n\nWhen I awoke again,\nI found myself at the edge of a garbage heap, transformed into a frog with a swollen belly,\nAlready dead, and I was sitting between its ears.\n\nLooking closely, what I thought was a mere mortal's home,\nWas in truth the dwelling of Okikirmui, a being of godlike power.\nAnd I, not knowing him as Okikirmui,\nWent there to play a prank.\n\nNow I shall die in this insignificant, wretched way,\nSo I warn all future frogs, never again play tricks on humans.\"\n\nThus spoke the swollen frog, and breathed its last.",

A joyful melody?\nI'd love to hear it again.\"\n\nOverjoyed by his interest, I sang once more: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\n\nThe young man then inquired:\n\"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?\nI wish to hear it closer.\"\n\nMy heart leaped with excitement! I hopped down to the lower edge of the hearth,\nSinging: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\n\nThe young man persisted:\n\"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?\nI wish to hear it even closer.\"\n\nNow truly thrilled, I hopped to the corner of the upper hearth,\nSinging loudly: \"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!\"\n\nSuddenly! The young man sprang to his feet,\nQuick as lightning, he grabbed a massive, burning log,\nAnd hurled it straight at me! Darkness crashed around me,\nAnd I knew no more.\n\nWhen I awoke, everything had changed.\nI lay at the edge of a garbage heap, a bloated, dead frog,\nAnd I was sitting right between its ears.\n\nLooking closer, I realized that what I'd mistaken for a simple house,\nWas in truth the dwelling of Okikirmui, a god of immense power.\nAnd I, not knowing him as Okikirmui,\nHad dared to play a foolish prank.\n\nNow I must die this meaningless, wretched death.\nSo I warn all frogs of the future: never, ever play tricks on humans!\"\n\nThus spoke the swollen frog, and with those final words, breathed its last.",
