    "english_translation_1": "The Song of the Little Wolf God, Sung by Himself\n\"Hotenao\"\n\nHotenao,\nOne day, feeling bored, I went to the beach,\nAs I was playing, a little man appeared.\nWhen I went downstream, he followed me downstream,\nWhen I went upstream, he also went upstream, blocking my path.\nThis happened six times downstream,\nAnd six times upstream. The little man,\nHis inherent temper flaring on his face, said,\n\"Pii pii!\nYou little brat, you bad little brat! If you do such things,\nTell me the old name and the current name\nOf this cape!\"\nI listened and, laughing, replied,\n\"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name\nOf this cape!\nIn the old days, because there were revered and great gods and people,\nThis cape was called the Cape of the Gods,\nBut now that the times have declined,\nIt is called the Cape of Nusa (御幣の岬)!\"\nUpon hearing this, the little man said,\n\"Piiton, piiton!\nYou little brat, if you really know,\nTell me the old name and the current name\nOf this river!\"\nListening, I said,\n\"Who doesn't know the old name\nAnd the current name of this river!\nIn the old, great times, this river\nWas called the River with the Swift Current,\nBut now that the world is declining, it is called the River with the Slow Current.\"\nUpon hearing this, the little man said,\n\"Piitonton, piitonton!\nIf you really say such things,\nLet us reveal each other's true nature.\"\nListening, I said,\n\"Who doesn't know your true nature!\nLong ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains\nAnd built a hunting hut, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.\nWhen that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.\nWhen Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side\nRose up. Okikirmui, angered by this,\nTook the hearth frame down to the river\nAnd threw it away.\nFrom there, that hearth frame flowed along the current,\nWent out to sea, and the gods watched\nAs it was struck by the waves from afar and the waves from here.\nThey thought, 'It is a waste that something handmade by the revered and great Okikirmui\nIs pointlessly drifting and decaying with the seawater,\nSo the gods\nTurned that hearth frame into a fish,\nAnd it was named Robuchi fish (炉縁魚).'\nHowever, that Robuchi fish doesn't know its own origin,\nSo it disguises itself as a person and wanders around.\nThat Robuchi fish is you!\"\nAs I said this, the little man's face\nChanged color as he listened,\n\"Piitonton, piitonton!\nYou are a small, wolf cub.\"\nAs soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.\nLooking after him, a single red fish\nMoved its tail fin and went far offshore.\nSo, the young wolf god told his story.",
