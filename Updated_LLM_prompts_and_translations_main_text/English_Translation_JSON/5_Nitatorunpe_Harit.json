    "english_translation_1": "The bog demon himself sang this song, \"Harits Kunna\":\n\nHarits Kunna\n\nOne day, the weather was fine,\nSo I peeked out from my bog,\nJust my eyes and mouth showing.\nFrom the direction of the shore,\nI heard the voices of men.\nI saw two young men approaching together.\n\nThe first seemed a hero,\nPossessing the qualities of a brave warrior,\nBeautiful as a god.\nBut the one who followed behind,\nHe looked unwell,\nPale of face.\nThey came along discussing something,\nAnd as they passed by my bog,\nRight in front of me,\nThe pale-faced man stopped.\nHe covered his nose and said,\n\"Oh, how foul! This wretched bog!\nPassing by this awful place,\nIt's so filthy! What is that stench?\"\n\nI only heard his words,\nBut I was enraged beyond measure,\nUnsure if I even existed anymore.\nI burst forth from the mud!\nThe earth split and cracked as I leaped.\nGnashing my teeth,\nI fiercely pursued them.\n\nThe first man, seeing this,\nTurned back like a fish darting around,\nSlipped under the pale man's arm,\nAnd fled far away.\nI chased the blue-faced man for a few steps,\nQuickly caught up,\nAnd swallowed him whole, head first.\n\nThen, with all my might, I chased after the other man,\nReaching a human village,\nA large settlement.\nI saw coming towards me,\nThe Fire Old Woman, the Divine Old Woman,\nIn red robes, six layers of them,\nWith a sash tied, wearing all six layers,\nAnd leaning on a red staff, she flew to my side.\n\n\"Well, well,\" she said,\n\"Why have you come to this Ainu village?\nNow, go back! Go back!\"\nAs she spoke, she raised her red staff, her metal staff,\nAnd struck me.\nFlames rained down from the staff,\nLike a downpour upon me.\n\nBut I paid no heed,\nGnashing my teeth,\nI chased after the man.\nHe ran through the village,\nLike a ring spinning around.\nI flew after him,\nAnd the earth split and cracked.\nThe village was in uproar,\nSome pulling their wives by the hand,\nOthers dragging their children,\nCrying and screaming,\nFleeing in a boiling frenzy.\n\nBut I cared not,\nRaising a storm of dust.\nThe Fire Old Goddess ran beside me,\nAnd tremendous flames flew over me.\n\nIn the midst of this,\nThe man darted into a house,\nAnd immediately burst out again.\nI saw him nocking a small arrow of artemisia to a small bow of artemisia,\nSmiling at me from afar, aiming.\nSeeing this, I found it amusing.\n\"How can such a tiny artemisia arrow cause harm?\"\nI thought, gnashing my teeth,\nAnd tried to swallow him head first.\n\nAt that moment, the man shot me square in the neck.\nAfter that, I knew no more.\nWhen I came to my senses,\nI was between the ears of a great dragon.\n\nThe villagers gathered,\nAnd the young man I had chased,\nGave loud instructions.\nThey meticulously cut up my corpse,\nCarried it to one place, burned it,\nAnd scattered the ashes\nBehind a rock on the mountain.\n\nOnly now do I realize,\nThat the one I thought was just a human,\nJust a young man,\nWas Okikirmui, a divine hero.\nI was a terrible, evil god, a demon god,\nAnd because I was near the human village,\nOkikirmui, thinking of the village's safety,\nProvoked me,\nMade me chase him,\nAnd killed me with an artemisia arrow.\n\nAnd the blue-faced man I swallowed,\nI thought he was human,\nBut it was Okikirmui who created a being from his own excrement,\nAnd brought it along.\n\nBecause I was a demon,\nI have now been cast into\nThe terrible, evil land of hell.\nFrom now on, there will be no danger,\nNo disturbance,\nIn the land of humans.\n\nI was a fearsome demon,\nBut I was defeated by the scheme of a single human,\nAnd now I face a meaningless death, a wretched end.\"\n\nSo spoke the bog demon.",
    "english_translation_2": "The Song of Harits Kunna, sung by the Marsh Demon himself:\n\nHarits Kunna,\nOne bright day,\nFrom my swamp, with just eyes and mouth peeking,\nI gazed out.\nIn the distance, from the shore, I heard voices.\nI saw two young men approaching side by side.\nThe one in front seemed a hero, possessing a hero's aura,\nBeautiful as a god.\nBut the one behind looked gaunt,\nHis complexion poor. They walked and talked,\nPassing by my swamp.\nJust as they reached me, the pale-faced man\nStopped, pinching his nose.\n\"Oh, how foul! This wretched swamp! Passing through this awful place\nIs so filthy! What is that stench? It's disgusting!\"\nI listened, and rage swelled within me, almost forgetting myself.\nI burst from the mire. I leaped up,\nThe earth cracked, the ground crumbled. I roared with fangs bared,\nFerociously chasing after them.\nThe one in front, sensing danger,\nTurned with the agility of a fish, darting under the pale man's\nArm and fleeing swiftly.\nI pursued the sickly man for a few steps,\nQuickly catching up and swallowing him whole.\nThen, with all my might, I chased after the one who had fled,\nReaching a human village, a large village.\nI saw approaching from there\nThe old woman of fire, the divine crone, dressed in red, six layers of robes,\nWith a sash, draped in six layers,\nLeaning on a red staff, rushing towards me.\n\"Hey, hey! What brings you to our Ainu village?\nGo back! Go back!\"\nShe cried, raising her red staff, her golden staff, striking\nAt me, the flames burning on the staff\nFalling upon me like rain.\nBut I was unmoved,\nRoaring with fangs bared, I continued to chase\nThe man, who ran through the village\nLike a spinning wheel. I pursued relentlessly,\nThe earth cracked, the ground crumbled. The whole village was in chaos,\nSome pulling their wives' hands, some pulling their children's hands, crying out\nAnd fleeing, a scene of turmoil.\nBut I paid no heed, stirring up clouds of dust.\nThe fire goddess ran to my side,\nGreat flames dancing around me.\nIn the midst of it, the man darted into a house\nAnd immediately ran out again.\nI saw him, holding a small mugwort bow, nocking a mugwort arrow,\nFrom there, smiling, aiming at me.\nSeeing that, I found it amusing.\n\"Such a tiny mugwort arrow could never harm me!\"\nI thought, roaring with fangs bared,\nJust as I was about to swallow him whole,\nThat man struck my neck hard.\nFrom then on, I knew nothing more.\nWhen I suddenly came to, I found\nMyself between the huge ears of a dragon.\nThe villagers gathered, and the young man I had chased\nCommanded loudly, carefully cutting my corpse into pieces,\nCarrying them to a place to burn, then casting the ashes\nBehind the mountain rocks.\nNow I understand that the one I thought was merely a human,\nA simple young man,\nWas Okikirmui, the divine hero.\nI am the terrible evil god, the demon god, and because I was\nNear the human village,\nOkikirmui deliberately provoked me for the village's safety,\nCausing me to chase him, then killing me with a mugwort arrow.\nAnd the pale-faced man I swallowed earlier,\nWhom I thought was human,\nWas a humanoid created by Okikirmui from his excrement,\nBrought along.\nI am the demon god, now sent to\nThe terrible, evil realm of hell.\nFrom now on, the human realm will be free from danger\nAnd without hindrance.\nI am the terrible demon god,\nYet I was defeated by a human's scheme,\nAnd now I can only die a boring death, a miserable death.\nSo spoke the Marsh Demon.",

They spoke in hushed tones,\nPassing near my swamp.\nAs they drew level, the sickly man halted,\nPinched his nose, and cried,\n\"A foul stench! This wretched swamp! To pass through such a place,\nSo vile! What is that sickening reek? It's utterly disgusting!\"\n\nI heard his words, and a rage consumed me,\nSo profound I forgot myself.\nI erupted from the mire! The earth cracked and split as I rose,\nFangs bared in a furious roar,\nI gave chase with relentless fury.\n\nThe first man, sensing the impending doom,\nTurned with the swiftness of a fish, darting beneath the pale man's arm,\nAnd fled with desperate speed.\nI pursued the sickly one for a few strides,\nSwiftly overtaking him, and swallowed him whole, headfirst.\n\nThen, with every ounce of my demonic might, I pursued the fleeing hero,\nReaching a human village, a sprawling settlement.\nThere, approaching me, I saw\nThe Fire Old Woman, the Divine Crone, adorned in crimson,\nSix layers of robes cascading around her,\nA sash cinching her waist, draped in six layers,\nLeaning upon a red staff, she hastened towards me.\n\n\"Halt, demon! What brings you to this Ainu village?\nTurn back!
