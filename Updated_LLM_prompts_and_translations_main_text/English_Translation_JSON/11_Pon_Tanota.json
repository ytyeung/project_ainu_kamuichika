    "english_translation_1": "A song sung by Little Okikirmui himself:\n\"This sand, red, so red.\"\n\nThis sand, red, so red,\nOne day, venturing upstream for play,\nI encountered a child of the devil.\nAlways, the devil's child possessed a beautiful air,\nA beautiful face, adorned in black robes,\nA small bow of walnut, with arrows of walnut he held.\nSeeing me, he grinned,\nsaying,\n\"Little Okikirmui, let us play.\nNow, I shall show you how to cut off the fish's roots.\"\nSo saying, with his walnut bow and walnut arrow,\nHe aimed and shot towards the water source.\nFrom the source, walnut water, turbid water flowed,\nAnd the salmon, as they tried to ascend,\nLoathing the walnut water, cried and retreated with the flow.\nThe devil's child, he grinned at this.\nSeeing this, I was angered,\nAnd with my silver bow and silver arrow,\nI aimed and shot towards the water source.\nFrom the source, silver water, pure water flowed,\nAnd the salmon, who had cried as they retreated,\nRegained their vigor in the pure water,\nLaughing and frolicking,\nSplashing and ascending the river.\nThen, the devil's child,\nHis inherent temper showing on his face,\nsaid,\n\"If you truly do such a thing, I shall show you how to cut off the deer's roots.\"\nAnd saying so, with his walnut bow and walnut arrow,\nHe shot into the vast sky.\nFrom the mountain's fields,\nWalnut wind, a whirlwind, blew forth,\nAnd from the mountain's fields,\nThe stags in one group,\nThe does in another,\nWere blown upwards by the wind,\nAscending neatly into the sky.\nThe devil's child, he grinned.\nSeeing this, I was enraged,\nAnd with my silver bow and silver arrow,\nI aimed and shot after the deer.\nFrom the heavens,\nSilver wind, pure wind, blew down,\nThe stags in one group,\nThe does in another,\nWere blown down upon the mountain's fields.\nThen, the devil's child,\nHis inherent temper showing on his face,\nsaid,\n\"Insolent one, if you truly\ndo such a thing, let us have a contest of strength.\"\nAnd saying so, he removed his outer garment.\nI, too, in a thin robe,\nGrappled with him. He grappled with me. From then on,\nWe wrestled, sometimes below, sometimes above,\nBut I was astonished by the devil's child's great strength.\nYet, finally, at a certain moment,\nI gathered all the strength in my waist, in my body,\nAnd lifted the devil's child\nUp to my shoulders,\nAnd the sound of me slamming him upon the mountain rocks\nResounded with a clang. After killing him and\nkicking him down to hell, all became silent.\nThat done, as I returned along the stream,\nFrom within the river, the voices of salmon laughing,\nThe sounds of play, rose clamorously,\nSplashing and echoing. In the mountain's fields,\nThe voices of stags and does laughing,\nThe sounds of play, filled the air,\nEating here and there. Seeing this, I was relieved,\nAnd returned to my home.\nSo, Little Okikirmui told his story.",

Clad in garments of black,\nHolding a small bow of walnut wood, and arrows to match.\nHe saw me and said with a grin:\n\"Little Okikirmui, come and play!\nI'll show you how to cut off the fish's path.\"\nSo saying, he notched a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,\nAnd shot it towards the source of the stream.\nFrom the source flowed water the color of walnut, murky and foul,\nThe salmon, swimming upstream,\nAverted by the walnut water, cried,\nAnd retreated downstream. The demon's child,\nSeeing this, merely laughed in triumph.\nMy anger flared at the sight,\nAnd I took out my small silver bow, notched a silver arrow,\nAnd shot it towards the source.\nFrom the source flowed silver water, clear and sweet,\nThe salmon, who had wept as they left,\nRegained their vigor in the clear water,\nLaughing and playing,\nSplashing and frolicking upstream.\nThe demon's child then\nRevealed his innate fury,\n\"If you insist, I'll show you how to cut off the deer's path!\"\nSaying this, he notched a walnut arrow to his walnut bow,\nAnd shot it towards the sky,\nThrough the trees of the mountain forests blew\nA walnut wind, a whirlwind.\nFrom the trees of the mountain forests, the stags on one side,\nThe does on the other, were blown into the sky,\nNeatly arranged, ascending to the heavens.\nThe demon's child, seeing this, laughed in triumph.\nMy rage knew no bounds,\nAnd I took up my silver bow, notched a silver arrow,\nAnd shot it towards the departing deer.\nFrom the sky fell a silver wind, a refreshing wind,\nThe stags on one side,\nThe does on the other,\nWere blown back to the trees of the mountain forests.\nThe demon's child then\nRevealed his innate fury,\n\"Arrogant fool, if you\nInsist on this, let us test our strength!\"\nSaying this, he removed his upper garment.\nI, too, was left in but a thin robe,\nAnd grappled with him. He held me tight.\nFrom then on, we wrestled and struggled,\nBut the demon child's strength,\nTruly astonished me. Yet, finally, at one moment,\nI used the strength of my waist, the strength of my whole body,\nAnd lifted the demon's child\nOnto my shoulders,\nSlamming him hard against the mountain rocks,\nWith a thunderous crash. Having killed him, and kicked him into hell,\nAll around was silent.\nWhen it was over, I returned along the river,\nAnd heard only the laughter of the salmon in the river,\nThe sounds of their play, resounding merrily,\nSplashing and frolicking. Through the trees of the mountain forests,\nThe laughter of the stags and does,\nThe sounds of their play, filled the air,\nThey were there, they were here,\nEating their fill. Seeing this,\nI felt at peace, and returned to\nMy home.\nLittle Okikirmui tells it so.",

    "comment": "After carefully comparing the two English translations with the original Japanese text, here's an analysis:\n\n**Translation 1: Pros and Cons**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   More literal translation, sticking closely to the original sentence structure.\n    *   Preserves the repetition in the original text, which can be important for conveying the chanting or storytelling aspect.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   Can sound a bit stilted or unnatural in English due to the literal translation.\n    *   Some phrases are less clear or require more interpretation from the reader.\n\n**Translation 2: Pros and Cons**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   More natural and flowing English, making it easier to read and understand.\n    *   Uses more descriptive language, enhancing the imagery and poetic feel.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   Takes more liberties with the original text, potentially losing some of the original nuance or emphasis.\n    *   Less literal, which might be a concern if accuracy is the top priority.\n\n**Choice of Better Translation:**\n\nTranslation 2 is slightly better because it prioritizes readability and natural flow while still capturing the essence of the story. While Translation 1 is more literal, it sacrifices clarity and poetic feel, making it less engaging for the reader.\n\n**Updated Translation:**\n\nBased on Translation 2, incorporating elements from Translation 1 to enhance accuracy and poetic flow, here's an updated translation:\n",
