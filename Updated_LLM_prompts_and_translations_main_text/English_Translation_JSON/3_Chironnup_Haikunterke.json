    "english_translation_1": "The Fox's Own Song:\n\"Haikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori\"\n\nHaikun Terekke Haikoshitemutori,\nUpon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,\nI sat in my place.\nOne day, I ventured out and saw,\nThe sea was calm and vast, and upon it,\nOkikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur\nSet out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this,\nThe wicked thoughts within me stirred.\nThis cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,\nUp and down, with light steps,\nI ran, my waist swaying gently.\nWith a heavy tone, like snapping wood,\nI cried, \"Pau, pau!\" and glared at the source of the river,\nSummoning the demon of the storm. Then, from the river's\nsource, a fierce wind, a whirlwind,\nErupted and entered the sea, and at once,\nThe upper sea became the lower, and\nThe lower sea became the upper. Okikirmui and the others'\nfishing boat, at the meeting place of the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land,\nMet with a sudden change and spun amidst the waves.\nA great wave, like a mountain,\nCrashed over the boat. Then,\nOkikirmui, Samayunkur, and Shupunramka\nRaised their voices and rowed the boat.\nThis small boat was blown like a falling leaf,\nOn the verge of capsizing, but\nAdmirable were the humans, strong and resilient,\nAnd the small boat glided through the wind,\nOver the waves.\nSeeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.\nWith light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,\nWith a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, \"Pau, pau!\"\nDevoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.\nAs I did so, at last, Samayunkur's\nhands bled from above and below,\nAnd he collapsed, exhausted.\nSeeing this, I secretly smiled.\nThen again, I devoted myself,\nWith light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,\nWith a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,\nCheering on the demon of the storm.\nOkikirmui and Shupunramka, the two of them,\nEncouraged each other and bravely rowed the boat,\nBut then, at one moment, Shupunramka's\nhands bled from above and below,\nAnd he collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,\nI secretly smiled.\nThen again, with light steps, I leaped, my waist swaying gently,\nWith a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried, devoting myself.\nBut Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.\nWith a single thin garment wrapped around his body,\nHe rowed the boat, until\nThe oar he held broke in his hands.\nThen, he leaped upon the exhausted Samayunkur,\nSnatched the oar he held, and rowed the boat alone.\nSeeing this, the wicked thoughts within me stirred.\nWith a heavy tone, like snapping wood, I cried,\nWith light steps, I ran, my waist swaying gently,\nDevoting myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.\nAs I did so, Samayunkur's rudder also\nbroke. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramka,\nTook his oar, and\nBravely rowed the boat.\nBut his oar was also broken by the waves.\nThereupon, Okikirmui stood\nIn the boat, amidst the fierce wind,\nNever imagining that a human like him could find me,\nHe gazed at the center of my eyes,\nUpon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.\nHis gentle face now filled with anger,\nHe fiddled with his bag,\nAnd from within, he took out a small mugwort bow and\nA small mugwort arrow.\nSeeing this, I secretly smiled.\n\"What can a human do to frighten me?\nWhat use is such a mugwort arrow?\"\nThinking this, upon this cape,\nThe cape of the land, the cape of the gods,\nUp and down, with light steps,\nI ran, my waist swaying gently, with a heavy tone,\nLike snapping wood, I cried, \"Pau, pau!\"\nPraising the demon of the storm.\nIn the midst of this, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew and\nPierced me right at the collar of my neck.\nAfter that, I lost all sense of what happened.\nWhen I came to, I found\nThe weather was wonderfully fine, and the sea was\nVast, with no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.\nWhat had happened? From the tip of my head\nTo the tip of my toes, it ached as if the bark of a tree was burning and shrinking.\nNever did I imagine that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so,\nThen, writhing in agony, I struggled,\nUpon this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,\nUp and down, crying and screaming,\nWrithing in agony, living and\nDying, day and night, until I lost\nAll sense of what had happened.\nWhen I came to, I found myself\nBetween the ears of a great black fox.\nTwo days later, Okikirmui arrived, looking like a god,\nSmiling and saying,\n\"How beautiful! The black fox god who watches over\nThe cape of the land, the cape of the gods,\nHad a good heart, a godly heart,\nAnd so died a beautiful death.\"\nSaying this, he took my head,\nBrought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone\nAs the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw\nAs the foundation of his wife's toilet,\nAnd my body rotted away with the earth.\nThen, day and night,\nSuffering from the foul stench, I died a meaningless, bad\ndeath.\nThough I was not merely a god of low rank,\nBecause I possessed a terribly wicked heart, I died a useless,\nbad death. Therefore,\nFoxes of the future, never\nHold wicked thoughts.\"\n\nSo the fox god told his story.",
