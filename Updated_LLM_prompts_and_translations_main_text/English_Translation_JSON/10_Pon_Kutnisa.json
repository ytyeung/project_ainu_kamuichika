    "english_translation_1": "This is the song sung by Little Okikirmui himself:\n\"Kutunisa Kutonkuton\"\n\nKutunisa Kutonkuton,\nOne day, I went to play near the source of the river.\nThere, I saw a little man,\nBending over, hammering stakes to build a walnut weir.\nWhen he saw me, he said,\n\"Who are you? My nephew, please help me.\"\nI looked and saw it was a walnut weir.\nWalnut water, muddy water,\nFlowed, and the salmon,\nHated the walnut water and cried as they returned.\nI was enraged,\nI snatched the mallet from the little man,\nAnd struck him in the center of his back with a *pon* sound.\nI broke the little man's back and killed him,\nAnd kicked him down to hell.\nI shook his walnut stake,\nIt seemed to reach beyond the six hells.\nThen, I put all the strength in my back, all the strength in my body,\nAnd broke the stake from its base,\nAnd kicked it down to hell.\nClear wind, clear water,\nFlowed from the source, and the salmon,\nWho had cried as they returned,\nRegained their spirit in the clear wind and clear water,\nAnd frolicked and laughed as they played,\nSplashing as they swam upstream.\nSeeing this, I was relieved,\nAnd returned along the stream.\nSo told Little Okikirmui.",

Nephew, lend me a hand.\"\nI looked closely, and the weir was indeed of walnut,\nThe sap of the walnut mixing with the muddy stream,\nThe salmon, wishing to swim upstream, hated the walnut's scent,\nWeeping, they turned and fled. A fire ignited within me,\nI snatched the mallet from the little person's hand,\nAnd struck his spine,\nRight in the center, a resounding \"bang!\"\nI broke his spine, I killed him,\nAnd kicked him into the abyss of hell. I tried to shake the walnut stakes he had made,\nThey seemed to stretch to the sixth level of hell and beyond.\nThen, with all the strength in my waist, all the power in my body,\nI snapped the stakes from their roots,\nAnd kicked them into hell as well.\nThe water source became clear again, fresh wind, clear water,\nFlowed down, and those who had wept and fled,\nThe salmon, nourished by the clear wind and water,\nRegained their vigor, they rejoiced and played,\nSplashing and struggling upstream.\nSeeing this, I was filled with joy,\nAnd I set out on the path home along the river. This is the story\ntold by little Okikirmui.",

    "comment": "Translation 1 Pros:\n*   More literal translation, preserving the original sentence structure.\n*   Simple and direct language.\n\nTranslation 1 Cons:\n*   Lacks vivid imagery and emotional depth.\n*   The phrase \"pon sound\" is awkward.\n\nTranslation 2 Pros:\n*   More descriptive and evocative language.\n*   Better flow and rhythm.\n*   Stronger emotional impact.\n\nTranslation 2 Cons:\n*   Less literal in some places, taking liberties with the original text.\n*   Some phrases are slightly verbose.\n\nChoice of Better Translation: Translation 2 is better because it captures the spirit and emotion of the original Ainu chant more effectively, even though it's less literal. The imagery is stronger, and the overall flow is more poetic.\n\nImprovements:\n*   Incorporate the simplicity of Translation 1 where appropriate.\n*   Maintain the accuracy of Translation 2 while streamlining the language.\n*   Use more vivid verbs and imagery.\n*   Keep the term \"Okikirmui\" as it is, since it's a proper noun.\n*   Replace \"pon sound\" and \"bang!\" with a more descriptive and culturally appropriate sound effect.\n*   Use \"weir\" instead of \"fish weir\" for conciseness.\n*   Use \"salmon\" instead of \"the salmon\" for better flow.\n*   Use \"Little Okikirmui\" instead of \"little Okikirmui\".",
