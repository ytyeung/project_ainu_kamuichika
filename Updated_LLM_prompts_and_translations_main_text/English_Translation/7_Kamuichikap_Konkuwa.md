梟の神が自ら歌った謡
         「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
昔私の物言う時は桜皮を巻いた弓の
弓把きゅうはの央を鳴り渡らす如くに
言ったのであったが,
今は衰え年老いてしまった事よ.
けれども誰か雄弁で
使者としての自信を持ってる者があったら,
天国へ五ツ半の談判
を言いつけてやりたいものだ.」と
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
私は言った,ところが入口で誰かが
「私をおいて誰が使者として雄弁で
自信のあるものがあるでしょう.」というので
見ると鴉からすの若者であった.
私は家に入れて,それから,たがつきのシントコの
蓋の上をたたきながら
鴉の若者を使者にたてる為
その談判を云いきかせて三日たって
三つ目の談判を話しながら見ると
鴉の若者は炉縁の後で
居眠りをしている,それを見ると,癪しゃくに
さわったので鴉の若者を
羽ぐるみ引っぱたいて殺してしまった.
それから又たがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら
「誰か使者として自信のある者が
あれば天国へ五ツ半の
談判を言いつけてやりたい.」と
言うと,誰かがまた入口へ
「誰が私をおいて,雄弁で
天国へ使者に立つほどの者がありましょう.」
と言うので見ると山のかけす
であった.
家へ入れてそれからまた
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の談判を話して
四日たって,四つの用向を言っているうちに
山のかけすは炉縁の後で居眠りをしている.
私は腹が立って山のかけすを羽ぐるみひっぱたいて
殺してしまった.
それからまたたがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら,
「誰か雄弁で使者として
自信のある者があれば,天国へ
五ツ半の談判を持たせてやりたい.」
と言うと,誰かが
慎つつしみ深い態度ではいって来たので見ると
川ガラスの若者,美しい様子で
左の座に坐った.それで私は
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の用件を夜でも
昼でも言い続けた.見れば
川ガラスの若者,何も疲れた様子もなく
聞いていて昼と夜を
数えて六日目に
私が言い終ると直ぐに天窗から
出て天国へ行ってしまった.
その談判の大むねは,人間の世界に
饑饉があって人間たちは今にも
餓死しようとしている.どういう訳かと
見ると天国に
鹿を司つかさどる神様と魚を司る神様とが
相談をして鹿も出さず魚も出さぬことに
したからであったので,神様たちから
どんなに言われても知らぬ顔をして
いるので人間たちは猟に
山へ行っても鹿も無い,魚漁に
川へ行っても魚も無い.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
鹿の神,魚の神へ使者をたてた
のである.
それから幾日もたって
空の方に微かな音がきこえていたが
誰かがはいって来た.見ると
川ガラスの若者,今は前よりも美しさを増し
勇ましい気品をそなえて
返し談判を述べはじめた.
天国の鹿の神や魚の神が
今日まで鹿を出さず魚を出さなかった
理由は,人間たちが鹿を捕る時に
木で鹿の頭をたたき,皮を剥ぐと
鹿の頭をそのまま山の木原に
捨ておき,魚をとると
腐れ木で魚の頭をたたいて殺すので,
鹿どもは,裸で泣きながら
鹿の神の許もとへ帰り,魚どもは
腐れ木をくわえて魚の神の
許へ帰る.鹿の神,魚の神は
怒って相談をし,鹿を出さず
魚を出さなかったのであった.がこののち
人間たちが鹿でも魚でも
ていねいに取扱うという事なら鹿も出す
魚も出すであろう,と鹿の神と
魚の神が言ったという事を詳しく申し立てた.
私はそれを聞いてから川ガラスの若者に
讃辞を呈して,見ると本当に
人間たちは鹿や魚を
粗末に取扱ったのであった.
それから,以後は,決してそんな事をしない様に
人間たちに,眠りの時,夢の中に
教えてやったら,人間たちも
悪かったという事に気が付き,それからは
幣ぬさの様に魚をとる道具を美しく作り
それで魚をとる.鹿をとったときは,鹿の頭も
きれいに飾って祭る,それで
魚たちは,よろこんで美しい御幣ごへいをくわえて
魚の神のもとに行き,鹿たちは
よろこんで新しく月代さかやきをして鹿の神
のもとに立ち帰る.それを鹿の神や
魚の神はよろこんで
沢山,魚を出し,沢山,鹿を出した.
人間たちは,今はもうなんの困る事も
ひもじい事もなく暮している,
私はそれを見て安心をした.
私は,もう年老い,衰え弱った
ので,天国へ行こうと
思っていたのだけれども,私が守護している人間の国に
饑饉があって人間たちが餓死しようとしているのに
構わずに行く事が出来ないので,
これまで居たのだけれども,今はもう
なんの気がかりも無いから,最も強い者
若い勇者を私のあとにおき人間の世を
守護させて,今天国へ行く所なのだ.
と,国の守護神なる翁神(梟)が
物語って天国へ行きました.と.

This is the English Translation 1.
The Owl God's Own Song: "Konkwa"

"Konkwa,
In the old days, when I spoke, it was like the sound of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark,
Resonating from the center of the *kyuha* (bow grip),
But now, alas, I am weakened and old.
Yet, if there were someone eloquent,
Confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven."

So I spoke, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* (lacquered box) with *tagatsuki* (metal fittings),
When someone at the entrance said,
"Who but I is so eloquent and confident as a messenger?"
And when I looked, it was a young crow.
I let him into the house, and then, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
To appoint the young crow as my messenger,
I explained the negotiation for three days,
But as I spoke of the third point, I saw
The young crow dozing behind the hearth.
Seeing this, I was enraged,
And I struck the young crow with all my feathers and killed him.

Then again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
"If there is anyone confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven."
Then someone again at the entrance said,
"Who but I is so eloquent
As to stand as a messenger to Heaven?"
And when I looked, it was a jay from the mountains.

I let him into the house, and then again,
Tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
I spoke of the negotiation of five and a half *yo*,
And after four days, as I spoke of the fourth point,
The mountain jay was dozing behind the hearth.
I was furious and struck the mountain jay with all my feathers
And killed him.

Then again, tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half *yo* to Heaven."
Then someone entered with
A respectful demeanor, and when I looked,
It was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance,
Who sat on the left side. And so I,
Tapping on the lid of the *shintoko* with *tagatsuki*,
Continued to speak of the five and a half points,
Night and day. And when I looked,
The young river crow showed no sign of fatigue,
Listening, and counting the days and nights,
On the sixth day, as soon as I finished speaking,
He went straight out through the skylight
And departed for Heaven.

The gist of the negotiation was this: in the human world,
There was a famine, and the humans were on the verge
Of starvation. When I investigated the reason,
I found that the gods in Heaven
Who controlled the deer and the fish
Had consulted and decided to withhold both deer and fish.
No matter what was said to them, they turned a deaf ear,
So when the humans went to the mountains to hunt,
There were no deer, and when they went to the rivers
To fish, there were no fish.
I was angered by this, so
I appointed a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

After many days had passed,
A faint sound could be heard in the sky,
And someone entered. When I looked,
It was the young river crow, now even more beautiful
And possessing a valiant dignity,
Who began to deliver the counter-negotiation.

The reason the deer god and the fish god in Heaven
Had withheld the deer and the fish until today
Was that when the humans caught deer,
They struck the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it,
They left the deer's head as it was in the mountain *kihara* (field),
And when they caught fish,
They killed them by striking their heads with rotten wood.
So the deer, naked and weeping,
Returned to the deer god, and the fish
Returned to the fish god, carrying the rotten wood in their mouths.
The deer god and the fish god were
Angry and consulted, and withheld the deer
And the fish. But if from now on
The humans treat both deer and fish
With care, then they will release the deer
And release the fish, so the deer god and
The fish god said, he reported in detail.

After hearing this, I offered praise to the young river crow,
And saw that indeed
The humans had treated the deer and fish
Carelessly. From then on,
I taught the humans in their sleep, in their dreams,
Never to do such things again, and the humans
Realized their wrongdoings, and from then on,
They made beautiful fishing tools like *nusa* (sacred wands),
And used them to catch fish. When they caught deer, they also
Decorated the deer's head beautifully and offered it in sacrifice.
So the fish rejoiced and carried the beautiful *gohei* (paper streamers)
To the fish god, and the deer
Rejoiced and returned to the deer god,
With newly shaved *sakayaki* (hair on the head).
The deer god and
The fish god were pleased and
Released many fish and many deer.
The humans now live without any hardship
Or hunger,
And I was relieved to see this.

I am now old, weakened, and frail,
And I was thinking of going to Heaven,
But because there was a famine in the human land that I protect,
And the humans were on the verge of starvation, I could not
Go without concern, so
I have remained until now, but now that there is
Nothing to worry about, I will place the strongest,
A young hero, in my place to protect the human world,
And now I am going to Heaven."

So spoke the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the land,
And departed for Heaven. So it is told.

This is the English Translation 2.
The Song of the Owl God Himself: 

"Konkwa"

"Konkwa,
In days of old, when I spoke, my voice resonated like a bowstring wrapped with cherry bark,
echoing from the center of the bow's handle.
But now, I have grown old, my years advancing.
Yet, if there be one eloquent and confident
to undertake the task of a messenger,
I shall dispatch them to the heavens to negotiate five and two-fifths of a matter."

As I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid, I spoke these words. Just then, a voice arose from the entrance:
"Who but I is so eloquent and confident as to bear the weight of this messenger's task?"

I looked and saw it was a young crow.
I welcomed it inside, and as I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
I began to explain the details of the negotiation to this young crow,
Three days passed,
and as I spoke of the third point of negotiation, I noticed
the young crow had fallen asleep by the hearth. Enraged, I seized
the young crow by its wings and beat it to death.

Then, I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid once more:
"If there be one confident in the task of a messenger,
I shall dispatch them to the heavens to negotiate five and two-fifths of a matter."

No sooner had I spoken than another voice called from the entrance:
"Who but I is so eloquent,
so capable of being a messenger to the heavens?"

I looked and saw it was a magpie.
I welcomed it inside, and again
Tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
explaining the five and two-fifths of the negotiation.
Four days passed, and as I spoke of the fourth point,
the magpie fell asleep by the hearth.
I was overcome with rage, seized the magpie by its wings, and beat it to death.

Afterward, I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid again:
"If there be one eloquent and confident
in the task of a messenger, I shall dispatch them to the heavens,
bearing five and two-fifths of a negotiation."

At that moment, one entered with a respectful demeanor. I looked closely and saw
it was a young dipper, graceful in form,
seated to my left. And so,
I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
explaining the five and two-fifths of the matter, day and night.

The young dipper, showing no sign of weariness,
listened quietly, tirelessly,
and on the sixth day,
as soon as I finished speaking, it flew
from the skylight, heading for the heavens.

The essence of this negotiation was that the human world
was suffering from famine, its people on the verge
of starvation. The reason for this,
was that the gods of the heavens,
the god of deer and the god of fish,
had decided not to send down deer and fish,
ignoring all pleas from the people.
Thus, the people went to the mountains
to hunt, but found nothing, and went to the rivers
to fish, but returned empty-handed.

Seeing this, I was filled with rage,
and so I dispatched a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

Days passed,
and a faint sound echoed from the sky,
and one entered. I looked closely and saw
it was the young dipper, now more beautiful than before,
radiating an aura of courage,
and it began to recount the negotiated response.

The deer god and the fish god of the heavens
had ceased sending down deer and fish
because humans, when catching deer,
would strike their heads with wood, and after skinning them,
would carelessly discard the deer heads in the mountains.
And when catching fish,
would strike their heads with rotten wood until they died.
Thus, the herds of deer, naked and weeping,
returned to the deer god, and the schools of fish,
mouths filled with rotten wood, returned to the fish god.
The deer god and the fish god,
overcome with rage, decided to no longer send down deer and fish.

But if, from now on,
humans treat the deer and fish with kindness,
then they would once again send down deer and fish,
so said the deer god and the fish god, explaining the reason in detail.

Hearing this, I expressed my admiration to the young dipper,
and realized that
humans had indeed
treated the deer and fish too harshly.

From that day on, to prevent people from repeating their mistakes,
I warned them in their dreams as they slept.
The humans realized
their errors, and from then on,
they crafted fishing tools as exquisitely as they would *nusa* offerings,
using them to catch fish. When catching deer, they would also
carefully adorn and offer the deer heads in ritual. Thus,
the fish joyfully carried beautiful *gohei* offerings
to the fish god, and the deer
happily groomed their *sakayaki* hairlines, returning to the deer god.
The deer god and the
fish god, seeing this, were overjoyed,
sending down abundant fish, sending down abundant deer.

The humans now faced no more hardship,
nor did they suffer from hunger,
and seeing this, I felt at peace.

I have grown old and frail,
and had intended to go to the heavens,
but thinking of the human realm I protect,
suffering from famine, its people on the verge of starvation,
I could not ignore them,
and so I remained here. But now,
I have no more attachments. I shall choose the strongest,
youngest warrior to inherit my position, protecting the human world,
and I, today, shall depart for the heavens."

The guardian deity of the land, the old Owl God,
having finished speaking, departed for the heavens. And so, the story ends.

"Konkwa,

echoing from the center of the *kyuha* (bow grip). It was a sound to behold!
But now, alas, I have grown old, my years advancing, and my voice is but a whisper of its former self.
Yet, if there be one eloquent and confident to undertake the task of a messenger,
I shall dispatch them to the heavens to negotiate five and two-fifths of a matter."

As I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* (lacquered box) lid, adorned with *tagatsuki* (metal fittings), I spoke these words. Just then, a voice arose from the entrance:

I welcomed it inside, and as I tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
I began to explain the details of the negotiation to this young crow.
Three days passed, and as I spoke of the third point of negotiation, I noticed

No sooner had I spoken than another voice called from the entrance:

I looked and saw it was a magpie. A flash of blue and white against the dim light.
I welcomed it inside, and again tapped the rim of my inlaid *shintoko* lid,
explaining the five and two-fifths of the negotiation.
Four days passed, and as I spoke of the fourth point,
the magpie fell asleep by the hearth. I was overcome with rage, seized the magpie by its wings, and beat it to death. Another disappointment!

Translation 2 is better because it uses more vivid and descriptive language, creating a more engaging and poetic narrative. It also maintains a good balance between accuracy and readability. Translation 1 is more literal and lacks the storytelling quality present in Translation 2. However, Translation 1 includes some useful cultural context (e.g., explaining 'kyuha', 'shintoko', 'tagatsuki', and 'nusa'), which enhances understanding. I will incorporate these explanations into the new translation while maintaining the poetic tone of Translation 2.
