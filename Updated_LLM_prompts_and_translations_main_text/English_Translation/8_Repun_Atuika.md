海の神が自ら歌った謡「アトイカ
トマトマキ クントテアシ フム フム!」

アトイカ トマトマキ クントテアシ フムフム
長い兄様,六人の兄様,長い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様,短い姉様,六人の姉様が
私を育てて居たが,私は
宝物の積んである傍に高床をしつらえ,その高床の上に
すわって鞘さや刻み鞘彫り
それのみを
事として暮していた.
毎日,朝になると兄様たちは
矢筒を背負って姉様たちと一しょに出て行って
暮方になると疲れた顔色で
何も持たずに帰って来て姉様たちは
疲れているのに食事拵こしらえをし,私にお膳を出して
自分たちも食事をして食事のあとが片附くと,
それから兄様たちは矢を作るのに忙しく手を動かす.
矢筒が一ぱいになると,みんな疲れているものだから
寝ると高鼾たかいびきを響かせてねむってしまう.
その次の日になるとまだ暗い中に
みんな起きて姉様たちが食事拵えをして私に膳を出し
みんな食事が済むと,また矢筒を背負って
行ってしまう.また夕方になると
疲れた顔色で何も持たずに帰って来て
姉様たちは食事拵え,兄様たちは矢を作って,
何時いつでも同じ事をしていた.
ある日にまた兄様たち姉様たちは
矢筒を背負って出て行ってしまった.
宝物の彫刻を私はしていたがやがて
高床の上に起き上り金の小弓に
金の小矢を持って外へ出て
見ると海はひろびろと凪なぎて
海の東へ海の西へ鯨たちが
パチャパチャと遊んで居る.すると
海の東に長い姉様,六人の姉様が手をつらねて輪をつくると,
短い姉様,六人の姉様が,輪の中へ鯨を追い込む,
長い兄様,六人の兄様,短い兄様,六人の兄様が
輪の中へ鯨をねらい射つと,その鯨の
下を矢が通り上を矢が通る.
毎日毎日彼等はこんな事をして
いたのであった.見ると海の中央に
大きな鯨が親子の鯨が上へ下へ
パチャパチャと遊んで居るのが見えたので
遠い所から金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえてねらい射ったところ,一本の矢で
一度に親子の鯨を射貫いてしまった.
そこで一つの鯨のまんなかを斬って
その半分を姉様たちの輪の中へ
ほうりこんだ.それから鯨一ツ半の鯨を
尾の下にいれて人間の国に
むかって行きオタシュツ村に
着いて一ツ半の鯨を
村の浜へ押し上げてやった.
それから海の上にゆっくりと
游いで帰って
来たところが,誰かが
息を切らしてその側をはしるものがあるので
見ると,海のごめであった.
息をきらしながら云うことには,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
勇マシイ神様,大神様,
あなたはなんの為に,卑しい人間共,悪い人間共に
大きな海幸をおやりになったのです.
卑しい人間共,悪い人間共は,斧もて
鎌をもて大きな海幸をブツブツ切ったり突っついたり
削り取っています,勇ましい神様
大神様さあ早く大海幸を
お取り返しなさいませ.あんなに沢山,海幸をおやりに
なっても卑しい人間たち悪い人間たちは
有難いとも思わずこんな事をします.」
と云うので私は笑って云う
ことには,
「私は人間たちに呉れてやったものだから
今はもう自分の物だから,人間たちが
自分の持物を鎌でつつこうが斧で
削ろうがどうでも
自分たちの自由に食べたらいいではないか
それがどうなのだ.」と云うと
海のごめは所在無げにしているけれども
私はそれを少しも構わず海の上を
ゆっくりとおよいで
もう日が暮れようとしている時に,私の海へ
着いた.見ると
十二人の兄様,十二人の
姉様は,彼の半分の鯨をはこび
きれなくてみんなで掛声高く
海の東に,グズグズしている.
私は実にあきれてしまった.
私はそれに構わずに家へ
帰り,高床の上にすわった.
そこで後ふりかえって人間の世界の方を
見ると,私が打ち上げた一ツ
半の鯨のまわりをとりまいてりっぱな男たちや
りっぱな女たちが盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば歓び躍り,後の砂丘
の上にはりっぱな敷物が敷かれて
その上にオタシュツ村の村長が
六枚の着物に帯を束たばね,六枚の着物を
羽織って,りっぱな神の冠,先祖の冠を
頭に冠り,神授の剣を腰に佩はき
神の様に美しい様子で手を高くさし上げ
礼拝をしている.人間たちは泣いて
海幸をよろこんでいる.
何をごめが人間たちが
斧で鎌で私の押し上げた鯨を
突っついていると云ったが,
村長をはじめ
村民は,昔から
宝物の最も尊いものとしている神剣を取り出して
それで肉を斬って搬はこんでいる.
それから,私の兄様たち姉様たちは帰って来る
様子もない.
二日三日たった時,窗の方に
何か見える様だ,それで
振りかえって見て見ると,窗の上に
かねの盃にあふれる程
酒がはいっていてその上に
御幣を取りつけた酒箸が載っていて,
行きつ戻りつ,使者としての口上を述べて云うには,
「私はオタシュツ村の人で
畏れ多い事ながらおみきを差し上げます.」と
オタシュツ村の村長が村民
一同を代表して私に礼をのべる
次第をくわしく話し,
「トミンカリクル カムイカリクル イソヤンケクル
大神様,勇ましい神様でなくて誰が,
この様に私たちの村に饑饉があって
もう,どうにも仕様がない程
食物に窮している時に哀れんで下されましょう.
私たちの村に生命を与えて下さいました事,
誠に有難う御座います,海幸をよろこび
少しの酒を作りまして,小さな幣ぬさを
添え,大神様に謝礼
申し上げる次第であります.」という事を
幣つきの酒箸が行きつ戻りつ申し立てた.
それで私は起き上って,かねの盃を
取り,押しいただいて
上の座の六つの酒樽の蓋ふたを開き
美酒を少しずつ入れて
かねの盃を窗の上にのせた.
それが済むと,高床の上に腰を下し
見ると彼の盃は箸と共に
なくなっていた.それから,鞘を刻み
鞘を彫り,していてやがて
ふと面をあげて見ると,
家の中は美しい幣で一ぱいになっていて
家の中は白い雲がたなびき白いいなびかりが
ピカピカ光っている.私はああ美しいと思った.
それからまた,二日三日たつと,
その時やっと,家のそとで,兄様たちや
姉様たちが掛声高く彼の鯨を
引っ張って来たのがきこえだした.私はあきれて
しまった.家の中へはいる様子を
眺めると,兄様たちや姉様たちは
たいへん疲れて,顔色も萎しおれている.
みんなはいって来て,沢山の幣を見ると,
驚いてみんななん遍もなん遍も拝した.
そのうちに,東の座の六つの酒樽は
溢れるばかりになって,神の好物の
酒の香が家の中に漂うた.
それから私は,美しい幣で家の中を飾りつけ,
遠方の神,近所の神を招待し
盛んな酒宴を張った.姉様たちは
鯨を煮て,神たちに出すと,
神たちは,舌鼓を打ってよろこんだ.
宴酣たけなわの頃私は起き上り
斯々かくかく,人間世界に饑饉があって
あわれに思い,海幸を打ち上げた次第や
人間たちをよくしてやると,悪い神々が
それをねたみ,海のごめが私に中
傷した事や,オタシュツ村の
村長が斯々の言葉をとって私に礼をのべ
幣つきの酒箸が使者になって来た事など
詳しく物語ると,神たちは
一度に揃って打ちうなずきつつ,
私をほめたたえた.
それからまた,盛な宴をはり
神たちの,そこに
ここに舞う音,躍る音は
美しき響をなし,姉様たちは
提子ちょうしを持って席の間を酌して
まわるもあり,女神たち
と共に美しい声で歌うもある.
二日三日たって宴を閉じた.
神々に美しい幣を二つ三つずつ
上げると神々は腰の央なかを
ギックリ屈めてなん遍もなん遍も礼をして,
みんな自分の家に立ち帰った.
そのあと,何時でも同じく長い兄様,六人の兄様
長い姉様,六人の姉様,短い姉様,六人の姉様
短い兄様,六人の兄様と一しょにい,
人間たちが酒を造るとその度毎に
私に酒を送り私のところへ幣をよこす.
今はもう,人間たちも食物の不足も
なんの困る事も無く平穏に
暮しているので,私は安心をしています.

The Song of the Sea God: An Atoika
Tomato Maki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!

Atoika Tomato Maki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!
My elder brothers, six in number, my elder sisters, six in number,
My younger brothers, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
They raised me, but I,
I had a raised platform built beside the treasures, and upon that platform,
I sat, carving and engraving scabbards,
That alone was my life's work.
Every morning, my brothers would
shoulder their quivers and go out with my sisters,
returning at dusk with weary faces,
empty-handed. My sisters,
despited their weariness, would prepare the meal, setting a tray before me,
then eating themselves. When the meal was done,
my brothers would busily make arrows.
When the quivers were full, they would all be so tired
they would fall asleep, snoring loudly.
The next day, while it was still dark,
they would all rise, my sisters preparing the meal and setting a tray for me.
When everyone had eaten, they would again shoulder their quivers
and depart. Again, in the evening,
they would return with weary faces, empty-handed,
my sisters preparing the meal, my brothers making arrows,
always doing the same things.
One day, again, my brothers and sisters
shouldered their quivers and went out.
I was carving treasures, but soon
I rose from the platform, took a golden bow
and golden arrows, and went outside.
The sea was vast and calm,
whales playing to the east and west,
splashing and frolicking. Then,
to the east, my elder sisters, six in number, joined hands to form a ring,
my younger sisters, six in number, driving the whales into the ring.
My elder brothers, six in number, my younger brothers, six in number,
aimed and shot at the whales within the ring, their arrows
passing beneath and above the whales.
Every day, they did this.
I saw in the center of the sea
a large whale and its calf playing,
leaping up and down. From afar,
I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow
and aimed, piercing both the whale and its calf with a single shot.
Then, I cut the whale in half
and threw half into my sisters' ring.
Then, with the remaining whale and a half,
I placed it beneath its tail and headed towards the land of humans,
arriving at Otasutsu village.
I pushed the whale and a half
onto the village beach.
Then, I slowly
swam back across the sea,
when someone came running beside me,
out of breath. It was the sea grebe.
Breathlessly, it said,
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
Brave God, Great God,
why have you given such a great sea bounty to the lowly humans, the wicked humans?
The lowly humans, the wicked humans, are using axes
and sickles to cut, poke, and scrape away at the great sea bounty.
Brave God,
Great God, please quickly
take back the great sea bounty. Even though you have given them so much,
the lowly humans, the wicked humans,
do not appreciate it and do such things!"
So I laughed and said,
"I have given it to the humans,
so now it is theirs. Let the humans
cut it with sickles or
scrape it with axes, let them eat it as they please.
What does it matter?" The sea grebe seemed discomfited,
but I paid it no mind and slowly swam across the sea,
arriving at my sea as the day was ending.
I saw
twelve brothers, twelve
sisters, unable to carry the half whale,
struggling together, shouting loudly,
grumbling to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.
I ignored them and went home,
sitting on the platform.
Then, looking back towards the human world,
I saw fine men and
fine women surrounding the whale and a half I had beached,
dressed in finery, rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty,
and on the dunes behind,
a fine mat was spread,
and upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,
bound in six layers of kimono and sash, wearing six layers of kimono,
crowned with a magnificent god's crown, an ancestral crown,
a divine sword at his waist,
looking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high
in prayer. The humans were crying
and rejoicing over the sea bounty.
What the grebe said about the humans
poking at the whale I had beached with axes and sickles was wrong.
The village chief and
the villagers were taking out the divine sword,
which they had always considered the most precious of treasures,
and using it to cut the meat and carry it away.
Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something seemed to appear in the window.
Looking back, I saw in the window
a golden cup overflowing
with sake, and upon it
were ceremonial chopsticks adorned with Nusa,
coming and going, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am from Otasutsu village,
and with great reverence, I offer you this sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu village,
representing all the villagers,
explained in detail how he was expressing his gratitude to me,
saying,
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
Great God, Brave God, who else
would have pity on our village, which was suffering from famine
and was in such dire straits
that we had no food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing in the sea bounty,
we have made a little sake,
added a small Nusa,
and are offering our thanks to the Great God."
This was what
the Nusa-adorned chopsticks conveyed, coming and going.
So I rose, took the golden cup,
held it high,
opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
poured a little of the fine sake into each,
and placed the golden cup in the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the platform
and saw that the cup and chopsticks
were gone. Then, carving
and engraving scabbards, I
suddenly looked up,
and the house was filled with beautiful Nusa,
white clouds drifting through the house, white lightning
flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."
Then, again, two or three days passed,
and at last, I heard my brothers and
sisters outside the house, shouting loudly as they
pulled the whale.
I was amazed.
Watching them enter the house,
my brothers and sisters were
very tired, their faces pale.
Everyone came in, and when they saw the many Nusa,
they were surprised and bowed many times.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
were overflowing, and the scent of the god's favorite
sake filled the house.
Then I decorated the house with beautiful Nusa,
invited the gods of far and near,
and held a grand banquet. My sisters
boiled the whale and offered it to the gods,
who smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I rose
and told in detail how there was a famine in the human world
and how I had taken pity on them and beached the sea bounty,
how the wicked gods were jealous of this
and how the sea grebe had slandered me,
and how the village chief of Otasutsu village
had expressed his gratitude to me in such words
and how the Nusa-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy.
The gods
nodded in unison,
praising me.
Then, again, we held a grand banquet,
and the sounds of the gods
dancing and leaping here and there
made a beautiful harmony, and my sisters
carried pitchers, serving sake between the seats,
and sang with beautiful voices along with the goddesses.
The banquet ended after two or three days.
I gave the gods two or three beautiful Nusa each,
and the gods bent low at the waist,
bowing many times, and
each returned to their own home.
After that, as always, my elder brothers, six in number,
my elder sisters, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
my younger brothers, six in number, were with me,
and whenever the humans made sake,
they would send sake and Nusa to me.
Now, the humans have no lack of food
and live in peace without any trouble,
so I am at ease.

This is the English Translation 2.
The song of the Sea God himself, "Atoika Tomatoma ki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!"

Atoika Tomatoma ki Kuntoteashi Hum Hum!
My eldest brother, six brothers, my eldest sister, six sisters.
My younger brother, six brothers, my younger sister, six sisters.
They raised me, and what did I do?
In a place overflowing with treasures, I built a high platform, and upon that platform,
I quietly carved scabbards,
Day after day, making my living thus.
Every morning, my brothers would
Carry their quivers, going out with my sisters,
And every evening, they would return weary,
Their hands empty. My sisters, though tired, would still prepare meals, setting the food before me,
And after eating themselves, they would clean up,
While my brothers busied themselves making bows and arrows.
Once the quivers were full, everyone, exhausted,
Would fall asleep, their snores shaking the heavens.
The next day, before dawn,
Everyone would rise, my sisters preparing meals, setting the food before me,
And after eating, they would carry their quivers,
And go out again. In the evening, they would
Return weary, their hands empty,
My sisters preparing meals, my brothers making bows and arrows,
Day after day, year after year, always repeating the same things.
One day, my brothers and sisters again
Carried their quivers and went out.
I, who had been carving treasures, soon
Rose and stood upon the high platform, holding a golden bow
And golden arrows, and went outside.
Looking out, the sea was vast and calm,
Whales frolicked in the east and west,
Playing and enjoying themselves. At that moment,
In the east, my eldest sister and six sisters held hands, forming a circle,
While my younger sister and six sisters drove the whales into the circle,
My eldest brother and six brothers, my younger brother and six brothers,
Aimed their arrows at the whales within the circle, the arrows
Passing beneath the whales, skimming above them.
Every day, they did this.
I saw in the center of the sea,
A giant whale and her child, rising and falling on the waves,
Playing and enjoying themselves,
So from afar, I nocked a golden arrow to my golden bow,
Aimed, and shot, an arrow
Piercing both the mother and child at once.
Then, I cut one of the whales in half,
Throwing half into my sisters' circle.
And the other half of the whale,
I placed tail-down and pushed it towards the land of humans,
Reaching the village of Otasutsu,
And pushed that half-whale
Onto the village's beach.
After that, I leisurely
Swam in the sea, returning,
When I heard someone
Running breathlessly beside me,
Looking closely, I saw it was a seagull.
It said, gasping for air:
"Tomin karikuru Kamui karikuru Iso yangke kuru
Brave God, Great God,
Why would you bestow such abundant sea bounty upon lowly humans, wicked humans?
Lowly humans, wicked humans, are using axes
And sickles to cut, stab,
And scrape the great sea bounty! Brave God,
Great God, please take back
The sea bounty! You have given them so much,
But lowly humans, wicked humans,
Are ungrateful and do such things!"
Hearing this, I laughed and said:
"Now that I have given the sea bounty to humans,
It is theirs. Whether humans
Stab it with sickles or
Scrape it with axes, it is up to them,
They can eat it however they wish,
What does it matter?"
The seagull, hearing this, was somewhat bewildered,
But I paid it no mind, continuing to
Swim leisurely in the sea,
As the sun began to set, I returned to my sea.
There,
Twelve brothers, twelve
Sisters, were struggling to carry
That half-whale, exhausted, shouting together,
Still slowly carrying it on the east side of the sea.
I was speechless.
I ignored them, returning directly
Home, and sat upon the high platform.
Then I looked back towards the human world,
And saw that around the half-whale
I had pushed onto the beach, were gathered
Well-dressed men and
Women, celebrating the sea bounty with joy,
On the dunes behind,
Were spread magnificent carpets,
The village chief of Otasutsu,
Wearing six kimonos, tightening his belt,
With a splendid crown of the gods, the crown of ancestors,
A divine sword at his waist,
In a godlike, solemn, and beautiful pose, raised both hands,
And offered prayers. The humans wept with joy,
Celebrating the sea bounty.
The seagull said that humans
Were stabbing the whale I pushed onto the beach with axes and sickles,
But in fact,
The village chief and
The villagers were taking out
The divine sword, considered the most precious treasure since ancient times,
Using it to cut the whale meat and carry it away.
Moreover, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of
Returning.
Two or three days passed, and I saw something
Near the window, so I
Turned to look, and saw on the window
Was placed a golden cup filled with
Fine sake, with
Decorated chopsticks laid across it,
A messenger pacing back and forth, chanting:
"I am from the village of Otasutsu,
Though it is presumptuous, I must offer this fine sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu, representing
All the villagers, expressed their gratitude in detail,
Saying:
"Tomin karikuru Kamui karikuru Iso yangke kuru
If not for the Great God, the Brave God,
Who would have had pity on our village, suffering from famine,
Having reached the end of our rope?
You have given our village life,
We are so grateful! We celebrate the sea bounty,
And have made a little sake,
And attached a small offering of inao,
To express our gratitude to the Great God."
The decorated chopsticks moved back and forth, stating this.
So I rose, took the
Golden cup, raised it above my head,
Opened the lids of the six sake barrels above my seat,
And poured the fine sake little by little into the
Golden cup, then placed the golden cup on the window.
Having done this, I sat on the high platform,
And the golden cup and chopsticks had
Disappeared. After that, I continued to carve scabbards,
Carving scabbards, and unconsciously
Looked up,
And saw the room filled with beautiful inao,
White clouds swirling within, white lightning
Flashing. I thought it was truly beautiful.
Two or three days passed again,
And then, I finally heard
Outside the door, my brothers and
Sisters shouting loudly, pulling that whale back. I was very surprised.
I watched them enter the house,
And saw that my brothers and sisters
Were very tired, their faces haggard.
Everyone entered the house, saw so many inao,
And repeatedly bowed in surprise.
Soon, the six sake barrels on the east side
Overflowed, and the fragrance of the gods' beloved
Sake filled the room.
After that, I decorated the room with beautiful inao,
Invited distant gods, neighboring gods,
And held a grand banquet. My sisters
Cooked whale meat, offering it to the gods,
Who praised it endlessly, very pleased.
As the banquet was in full swing, I rose,
And explained in detail how the human world was suffering from famine,
And how I had pity on them, pushing the sea bounty onto the beach,
And how I had treated humans kindly, but was envied by evil gods,
And how the seagull slandered me,
And how the village chief of Otasutsu
Expressed his gratitude in such and such words,
And how the chopsticks decorated with inao came as messengers, and so on.
The gods listened,
And unanimously nodded in agreement,
Praising me.
After that, I held another grand banquet,
The gods'
dancing, singing,
Intertwined into beautiful music, my sisters
Holding pitchers, pouring sake at the tables,
Some singing with the goddesses.
Two or three days passed, and the banquet ended.
I gave two or three beautiful inao
To the gods, who bowed,
Repeatedly, and
Returned to their homes.
After that, I was always with my eldest brother, six brothers,
Eldest sister, six sisters, younger sister, six sisters,
Younger brother, six brothers,
And every time humans brewed sake,
They would send me sake and inao.
Now, humans no longer have to worry about a lack of food,
Living a peaceful
Life, and I am at ease.

My eldest brothers, six in number, my eldest sisters, six in number,

What does it matter?" The sea grebe seemed discomfited,
but I paid it no mind and slowly swam across the sea,
arriving at my sea as the day was ending.

I saw
twelve brothers, twelve
sisters, unable to carry that half-whale,
struggling together, shouting loudly,
grumbling to the east of the sea.
I was truly amazed.

I ignored them and went home,
sitting on the platform.
Then, looking back towards the human world,
I saw fine men and
fine women surrounding the half-whale I had beached,
dressed in finery, rejoicing and dancing over the sea bounty,
and on the dunes behind,
a fine mat was spread,
and upon it, the village chief of Otasutsu village,
bound in six layers of kimono and sash, wearing six layers of kimono,
crowned with a magnificent god's crown, an ancestral crown,
a divine sword at his waist,
looking as beautiful as a god, raising his hands high
in prayer. The humans were crying
and rejoicing over the sea bounty.

What the grebe said about the humans
poking at the whale I had beached with axes and sickles was wrong.
The village chief and
the villagers were taking out the divine sword,
which they had always considered the most precious of treasures,
and using it to cut the meat and carry it away.

Then, my brothers and sisters showed no sign of returning.
Two or three days passed, and something seemed to appear in the window.
Looking back, I saw in the window
a golden cup overflowing
with sake, and upon it
were ceremonial chopsticks adorned with Nusa,
coming and going, delivering a message as an envoy, saying,
"I am from Otasutsu village,
and with great reverence, I offer you this sake."
The village chief of Otasutsu village,
representing all the villagers,
explained in detail how he was expressing his gratitude to me,
saying,
"Tomin Karikuru Kamuy Karikuru Isoyankekuru
Great Kamuy, Brave Kamuy, who else
would have pity on our village, which was suffering from famine
and was in such dire straits
that we had no food?
Thank you truly for giving life to our village.
Rejoicing in the sea bounty,
we have made a little sake,
added a small Nusa,
and are offering our thanks to the Great Kamuy."
This was what
the Nusa-adorned chopsticks conveyed, coming and going.

So I rose, took the golden cup,
held it high,
opened the lids of the six sake barrels in the upper seat,
poured a little of the fine sake into each,
and placed the golden cup in the window.
When that was done, I sat down on the platform
and saw that the cup and chopsticks
were gone. Then, carving
and engraving scabbards, I
suddenly looked up,
and the house was filled with beautiful Inao,
white clouds drifting through the house, white lightning
flashing brightly. I thought, "Ah, how beautiful."

Then, again, two or three days passed,
and at last, I heard my brothers and
sisters outside the house, shouting loudly as they
pulled the whale.
I was amazed.
Watching them enter the house,
my brothers and sisters were
very tired, their faces pale.
Everyone came in, and when they saw the many Inao,
they were surprised and bowed many times.
Meanwhile, the six sake barrels in the eastern seat
were overflowing, and the scent of the Kamuy's favorite
sake filled the house.

Then I decorated the house with beautiful Inao,
invited the Kamuy of far and near,
and held a grand banquet. My sisters
boiled the whale and offered it to the Kamuy,
who smacked their lips and rejoiced.
When the banquet was at its height, I rose
and told in detail how there was a famine in the human world
and how I had taken pity on them and beached the sea bounty,
how the wicked Kamuy were jealous of this
and how the sea grebe had slandered me,
and how the village chief of Otasutsu village
had expressed his gratitude to me in such words
and how the Nusa-adorned chopsticks had come as an envoy.
The Kamuy
nodded in unison,
praising me.

Then, again, we held a grand banquet,
and the sounds of the Kamuy
dancing and leaping here and there
made a beautiful harmony, and my sisters
carried pitchers, serving sake between the seats,
and sang with beautiful voices along with the goddesses.
The banquet ended after two or three days.
I gave the Kamuy two or three beautiful Inao each,
and the Kamuy bent low at the waist,
bowing many times, and
each returned to their own home.

After that, as always, my eldest brothers, six in number,
my eldest sisters, six in number, my younger sisters, six in number,
my younger brothers, six in number, were with me,
and whenever the humans made sake,
they would send sake and Inao to me.
Now, the humans have no lack of food
and live in peace without any trouble,
so I am at ease.

## Analysis of the Two English Translations

**Translation 1: Pros**
*   **Literal Accuracy:** Translation 1 hews closely to the original Japanese sentence structure and word order, which can be beneficial for understanding the literal meaning.
*   **Completeness:** It includes all the details present in the original text.

**Translation 1: Cons**
*   **Awkward Phrasing:** The close adherence to the original structure sometimes results in unnatural or awkward English phrasing.
*   **Lack of Flow:** The translation can feel somewhat disjointed and lacks a smooth, poetic flow.

**Translation 2: Pros**
*   **Improved Flow:** Translation 2 takes liberties with sentence structure to create a more natural and readable English narrative.
*   **Poetic Tone:** It attempts to capture the poetic essence of the original chant, using more evocative language.

**Translation 2: Cons**
*   **Omission of Details:** In its pursuit of flow, Translation 2 occasionally omits details present in the original Japanese text.
*   **Interpretive Leaps:** There are instances where the translation seems to interpret rather than directly translate, potentially altering the original meaning.

**Choice of Better Translation:**

Translation 1 is slightly better due to its higher accuracy in conveying the original meaning. While Translation 2 has a better flow, its occasional omissions and interpretive leaps make it less reliable as a translation.

## Updated Translation Strategy

The updated translation will aim to combine the strengths of both versions:

*   **Accuracy:** Prioritize the accurate conveyance of the original Japanese meaning, using Translation 1 as the base.
*   **Flow:** Incorporate the improved sentence structure and phrasing from Translation 2 to enhance readability.
*   **Poetic Tone:** Use more evocative language where appropriate to capture the poetic essence of the chant, while ensuring accuracy.
*   **Clarity:** Use modern and simple English for easy understanding.
*   **Cultural Sensitivity:** Retain original terms like "Kamuy", "Nusa", and "Inao" where direct translation is impossible or would diminish the cultural significance.
