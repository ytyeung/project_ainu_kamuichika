兎が自ら歌った謡「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら兄様のあとをしたって山へ行きました.
毎日毎日兄様のあとへ行って見ると
人間が弩いしゆみを仕掛けて置いてあるとその弩を兄様が
こわしてしまう,それを私は笑うのを
常としていたのでこの日また
行って見たら,ちっとも
思いがけない
兄様が弩にかかって泣き叫んでいる.
私はビックリして,兄様のそばへ
飛んで行ったら兄様は
泣きながら云うことには,
「これ弟よ,今これから
お前は走って行って
私たちの村の後へ着いたら
兄様が弩にかかったよ――,フオホホーイと
大声でよぶのだよ.」
私はきいて
ハイ,ハイ,と返辞をして,それから
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら来て
私たちの村の村後へ着きました.
そこではじめて兄様が私を使いによこしたことを
思い出しました,私は大声で叫び声を挙げようとした
が,兄様が何を言って私を使によこしてあったのか
すっかり私は忘れていました.そこに立ちつくして
思い出そうとしたがどうしてもだめだ.
それからまた
二つの谷を越え三つの谷を越え
後へ逆飛び逆躍びしながら
兄様のいる所へ来て
見ると誰もいない.
兄様の血だけがそこらに附いていた.
(ここまでで話は外へ飛ぶ)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
毎日毎日私は山へ行って
人間が弩を仕掛けてあるのをこわして
それを面白がるのが常であった所が
ある日また,前の所に弩が仕掛けて
あると,その側に小さい蓬よもぎの弩が
仕掛けてある,
私はそれを見ると
「こんな物,何にする物だろう.」
と思っておかしいので
ちょとそれに触って見た,直ぐに逃げようと
したら,思いがけ
なく,その弩にいやという程
はまってしまった.
逃げようともがけば
もがくほど,強くしめられるのでどうする事も
出来ないので,私は泣いて
いると,私の側へ何だか
飛んで来たので見るとそれは私の弟
であった.私はよろこんで,私たちの一族のものに
この事を知らせる様に言いつけてやったが
それからいくら待っても何の音もない.
私は泣いていると,私の側へ
人の影があらわれた.見ると,
神の様な美しい人間の若者
ニコニコして,私を取って,
どこかへ持って行った.見ると
大きな家の中が神の宝物で
一ぱいになっている.
彼かの若者は火を焚いて,
大きな鍋を火にかけて,掛けてある刀を引き抜いて
私のからだを皮のままブツブツに切って
鍋一ぱいに入れそれから鍋の下へ頭を突き入れ突き入れ
火を焚きつけ出した.どうかして
逃げたいので私は人間の若者の隙を
ねらうけれども,人間の若者はちっとも私から
眼をはなさない.
「鍋が煮え立って私が煮えてしまったら,なんにも
ならないつまらない死方,悪い死方をしなければならない.」と
思って人間の若者の油断を
ねらってねらって,やっとの事
一片の肉に自分を化かわらして
立ち上る湯気に身を交まじえて鍋の椽に
上り,左の座へ飛び下りると直ぐに
戸外へ飛び出した,泣きながら
飛んで息を切らして逃げて来て
私の家へ着いて
ほんとうにあぶないことであったと胸撫で下した.
後ふりかえって見ると,
ただの人間,ただの若者とばかり
思っていたのはオキキリムイ,神の様な強い方
なのでありました.
ただの人間が仕掛けた弩だと思って
毎日毎日悪戯をしたのをオキキリムイ
は大そう怒って蓬の小弩で
私を殺そうとしたのだが,私も
ただの身分の軽い神でもないのに,つまらない死方,悪い死方
をしたら,私の親類のもの共も,困り惑うであろう
事を不憫に思って下されて
おかげで,私が逃げても追いかけなかった
のでありました.
それから,前には,兎は
鹿ほども体の大きなものであったが,
この様な悪戯を私がしたために
オキキリムイの一つの肉片ほど小さくなったのです.
これからの私たちの仲間はみんなこの位の
からだになるのであろう.
これからの兎たちよ,決していたずらをしなさるな.
と,兎の首領が子供等を教えて死にました.

The Song of the Rabbit: "Sanpaya Tereke"

Across two valleys, across three, I hopped and skipped,
following my elder brother to the mountains in playful glee.
Each day I trailed behind, only to find
humans had set a crossbow trap, which my brother would unwind.
I'd laugh at the sight, a common delight.
But one day, oh, what a fright!
Unexpectedly, my brother was caught in the snare,
crying out in utter despair.

Startled, I rushed to his side with a leap,
He spoke through tears, his voice so deep:
"Dear brother, run with haste, don't delay,
Go to our village and loudly say,
'Your brother is caught in a crossbow's hold!' – cry out, 'Hoh ho-hoy!' be bold."

I listened close, "Yes, yes," I replied,
Then bounded away, my playful spirit my guide.
Across two valleys, across three, I flew,
Arriving at our village, the task I must do.

But then it struck me, the message I bore,
What my brother had said, I couldn't recall anymore.
I stood there, blank, trying to seize
the words he entrusted, but found no ease.

So back I went, with leaps reversed,
Across three valleys, my heart immersed
in worry and dread. I reached the place,
But my brother was gone, leaving not a trace.
Only his blood stained the ground,
a silent testament to what was found.

(Here the story takes a turn, a different tale to burn)

Ketoka woi woi Ketoka, Ketoka woi Ketoka
Day after day, I'd venture to the mountain's peak,
destroying human crossbows, a mischievous streak.
I found such joy in this playful game,
Until one day, things wouldn't be the same.

At the usual spot, a crossbow stood,
But beside it, a tiny one, made of yomogi wood.
I gazed at it, with curious eyes,
"What's this for?" I wondered with surprise.
Amused, I touched it, then tried to flee,
But unexpectedly, it ensnared me!

The more I struggled, the tighter it grew,
Helpless, I cried, not knowing what to do.
Then something flew near, a welcome sight,
It was my brother, bathed in golden light!
I rejoiced, and bid him to tell our kin
Of my plight, trapped within.

But time passed, and no one came,
I wept alone, consumed by shame.
Then a shadow appeared, a figure so grand,
A beautiful human youth, like a god in the land.
Smiling, he seized me, and carried me away,
To a grand house, filled with treasures on display.

He lit a fire, and placed a pot above,
Then drew a knife, showing little love.
He chopped my body, skin and all,
Filling the pot, answering darkness' call.
Then, headfirst, he shoved me down below,
stoking the flames, watching the fire glow.

I yearned to escape, to find a way,
Watching the youth, hoping for disarray.
"If I boil and die, a pointless end,
A wretched death, my spirit can't mend!"

So I waited, watching for a chance,
To turn myself into a piece of meat, a fleeting trance.
I mingled with the steam, rising high,
Then leaped to the pot's edge, beneath the sky.
I jumped to the left, then bolted outside,
Fleeing in tears, with nowhere to hide.

I ran to my home, breathless and weak,
Relieved to be safe, no longer meek.
Looking back, I realized with a start,
The human youth, so kind at heart,
Was none other than Okikirmui, a god of might,
Whose power I'd challenged, with foolish delight.

He was angered by my daily pranks,
And sought to kill me with yomogi shanks.
But I, too, am a god, though of lesser renown,
And a pointless death would bring my kin down.
He pitied their plight, their sorrow and pain,
And allowed me to flee, escaping his reign.

From that day on, the rabbit's form,
once as large as a deer, weathering every storm,
shrank to the size of Okikirmui's meat,
a consequence of mischief, bitter and sweet.
Our descendants will all be this small,
A reminder to heed the lesson's call.

"Rabbits of the future, never play pranks,
Or face the wrath of the divine ranks!"
So spoke the rabbit chief, before his last breath,
A warning against folly, a lesson in death.

The Song of the Rabbit, Sung by Himself: "Sanpaya Tereke"

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys I leaped, over three I hopped,
Playing and frolicking, following my elder brother into the mountains.
Day after day, behind my brother, I saw
The crossbow traps set by humans. My brother would
Destroy them all, and I would laugh at this.
One day, as usual, I went along, but
Never did I imagine
My brother would be caught in a crossbow, wailing in pain.
Startled, I rushed to his side.
My brother cried out:
"Little brother, quickly now,
Run back behind our village
And shout loudly – Brother is trapped by a crossbow, hoo-ooh-hoo!"
I listened,
Responding, "Yes! Yes!" and then
Across two valleys I leaped, over three I hopped,
Playing and frolicking, arriving
Behind our village.
It was then I remembered why my brother had sent me.
I was about to shout,
But I completely forgot the words he wanted me to convey.
I stood there, trying to recall,
But I couldn't remember at all.
Then, I
Leaped across two valleys, hopped over three,
Backwards, jumping,
Returning to where my brother was,
But he was nowhere to be found.
Only his blood scattered all around.

(The story shifts in a new direction)

Ketoka woiwoi ketoka, ketoka woi ketoka,
Day after day, I went into the mountains,
Destroying the crossbow traps set by humans,
Taking pleasure in it.
One day, I came to the usual place and found
A crossbow set there, and beside it
A small *yomogi* (艾草) crossbow.
Seeing it, I thought,
"What use is something like this?"
Finding it laughable, I
Touched it slightly, intending to run away immediately,
But never did I imagine
I would be tightly,
Firmly trapped by that crossbow.
The more I struggled,
The tighter the bonds became, and I was helpless,
Only able to weep.
Then, something
Flew to my side. I looked and saw it was my younger brother.
Overjoyed, I told him to
Inform our people of this,
But after waiting a long time, there was no news.
I wept, and then
A figure appeared. I looked closely and saw
A human youth, as beautiful as a god.
Smiling, he seized me
And took me to a certain place. I discovered
It was a huge house, filled with sacred treasures.
That youth lit a fire,
Placed a large pot over the flames, drew a hanging knife,
Chopped my body, skin and bones, into small pieces,
Filled the entire pot, then placed the pot on my head
And began to cook me. I thought only of
Escaping from here, and looked for an opening in the human youth's watchfulness,
But he watched me closely.
"If the pot boils and I am cooked to pieces, it will be
A meaningless, ugly death."
Thinking this, I looked for a moment of carelessness from the human youth,
And finally, I transformed myself into a slice of meat,
Mixed into the rising steam, climbed to the edge of the pot,
Jumped onto the seat to the left, and then immediately
Dashed outside, weeping,
Panting, I fled back
To my home,
Finally relieved, grateful to have escaped.
Looking back,
I realized that what I thought was just a human, an ordinary youth,
Was actually *Okikirmui*, a being as powerful as a god.
What I thought were just human crossbows,
Which I mischievously destroyed every day, angered *Okikirmui*.
He wanted to kill me with a small *yomogi* crossbow, but I am not
Just a low-ranking god. If I were to die meaninglessly, die ugly,
My kin would be troubled.
He pitied my situation,
So even though I escaped, he did not pursue me.
From then on, originally
The rabbit had a body as large as a deer,
But because I played such a prank,
I became as small as a slice of meat from *Okikirmui*.
From now on, our companions will probably all become this small
In body.
From now on, rabbits, never play pranks again.
The rabbit leader taught his children this, and then passed away.

After a thorough comparison, Translation 2 is more accurate to the original Japanese text, especially in conveying the nuances of the Ainu chant. It maintains a closer structure to the original, making it easier to trace the meaning. However, it lacks the poetic flow and storytelling quality present in Translation 1. Translation 1 takes more liberty with the text, adding a layer of poetic interpretation that, while beautiful, sometimes veers from the literal meaning. For example, Translation 1 added the line "Whose power I'd challenged, with foolish delight", which is not a direct translation of the original text. Translation 2 is more literal, but less engaging. Therefore, I will use Translation 2 as the base and incorporate the poetic elements from Translation 1 to create a final, improved translation.

Pros of Translation 1:
*   Poetic and engaging storytelling.
*   Smooth and natural English flow.
*   Effective use of imagery and emotion.

Cons of Translation 1:
*   Less literal, with added interpretations.
*   Some phrases deviate from the original meaning.
*   Can be less precise in conveying specific details.

Pros of Translation 2:
*   More accurate and literal translation.
*   Closer adherence to the original structure.
*   Preserves specific cultural terms like "yomogi".

Cons of Translation 2:
*   Less poetic and less engaging.
*   Can sound somewhat stiff or awkward in English.
*   Lacks the storytelling flair of Translation 1.
