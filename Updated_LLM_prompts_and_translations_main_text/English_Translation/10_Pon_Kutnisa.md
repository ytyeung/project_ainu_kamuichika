小オキキリムイが自ら歌った謡
「クツニサ クトンクトン」

クツニサ クトンクトン
ある日に水源の方へ遊びに
出かけたら,水源に一人の小男が
胡桃くるみの木の簗やなをたてるため杭を打つのに
腰を曲げ曲げしている.
私を見ると,いう事には,
「誰だ? 私の甥よ,私に手伝ってお呉れ.」
という.見ると,胡桃の簗
なものだから,胡桃の水,濁った水
が流れて来て鮭どもが
上って来ると胡桃の水が嫌なので
泣きながら帰ってゆく.私は腹が立ったので
小男の持っている杭を打つ槌を
引ったくり小男の腰の央を
私がたたく音がポンと響いた.小男の
腰の央を折ってしまって殺してしまい
地獄へ踏み落してやった.彼の胡桃の杭を
揺り動かして見ると六つの地獄の
彼方まで届いている様だ.
それから,私は腰の力,からだ中の力を
出して,その杭を根本から
折ってしまい,地獄へ踏み落してしまった.
水源から清い風,清い水が
流れて来て,泣きながら帰って行った.
鮭どもは清い風,清い水に
気を恢復して,大さわぎ大笑いして遊び
ながら,パチャパチャと
上って来た.私はそれを見て,安心をし
流れに沿うて帰って来た.と
小さいオキキリムイが物語った.

This is the English Translation 1.
This is the song sung by Little Okikirmui himself:
"Kutunisa Kutonkuton"

Kutunisa Kutonkuton,
One day, I went to play near the source of the river.
There, I saw a little man,
Bending over, hammering stakes to build a walnut weir.
When he saw me, he said,
"Who are you? My nephew, please help me."
I looked and saw it was a walnut weir.
Walnut water, muddy water,
Flowed, and the salmon,
Hated the walnut water and cried as they returned.
I was enraged,
I snatched the mallet from the little man,
And struck him in the center of his back with a *pon* sound.
I broke the little man's back and killed him,
And kicked him down to hell.
I shook his walnut stake,
It seemed to reach beyond the six hells.
Then, I put all the strength in my back, all the strength in my body,
And broke the stake from its base,
And kicked it down to hell.
Clear wind, clear water,
Flowed from the source, and the salmon,
Who had cried as they returned,
Regained their spirit in the clear wind and clear water,
And frolicked and laughed as they played,
Splashing as they swam upstream.
Seeing this, I was relieved,
And returned along the stream.
So told Little Okikirmui.

This is the English Translation 2.
A song sung by little Okikirmui himself:
"Kutnisa Kuton Kutton"

Kutnisa Kuton Kutton,
One day, as I wandered to the source of the waters,
I saw a little person by the water's edge,
Bent over, striking again and again,
Trying to build a fish weir of walnut wood.
He saw me and said:
"Who are you? Nephew, lend me a hand."
I looked closely, and the weir was indeed of walnut,
The sap of the walnut mixing with the muddy stream,
The salmon, wishing to swim upstream, hated the walnut's scent,
Weeping, they turned and fled. A fire ignited within me,
I snatched the mallet from the little person's hand,
And struck his spine,
Right in the center, a resounding "bang!"
I broke his spine, I killed him,
And kicked him into the abyss of hell. I tried to shake the walnut stakes he had made,
They seemed to stretch to the sixth level of hell and beyond.
Then, with all the strength in my waist, all the power in my body,
I snapped the stakes from their roots,
And kicked them into hell as well.
The water source became clear again, fresh wind, clear water,
Flowed down, and those who had wept and fled,
The salmon, nourished by the clear wind and water,
Regained their vigor, they rejoiced and played,
Splashing and struggling upstream.
Seeing this, I was filled with joy,
And I set out on the path home along the river. This is the story
told by little Okikirmui.

I snatched the mallet from the little person's hand,

Right in the center, a resounding *Kacha!*
I broke his spine, I killed him,
And kicked him into the abyss of hell. I tried to shake the walnut stakes he had made,
They seemed to stretch to the sixth level of hell and beyond.
Then, with all the strength in my waist, all the power in my body,

Translation 1 Pros:
*   More literal translation, preserving the original sentence structure.
*   Simple and direct language.

Translation 1 Cons:
*   Lacks vivid imagery and emotional depth.
*   The phrase "pon sound" is awkward.

Translation 2 Pros:
*   More descriptive and evocative language.
*   Better flow and rhythm.
*   Stronger emotional impact.

Translation 2 Cons:
*   Less literal in some places, taking liberties with the original text.
*   Some phrases are slightly verbose.

Choice of Better Translation: Translation 2 is better because it captures the spirit and emotion of the original Ainu chant more effectively, even though it's less literal. The imagery is stronger, and the overall flow is more poetic.

Improvements:
*   Incorporate the simplicity of Translation 1 where appropriate.
*   Maintain the accuracy of Translation 2 while streamlining the language.
*   Use more vivid verbs and imagery.
*   Keep the term "Okikirmui" as it is, since it's a proper noun.
*   Replace "pon sound" and "bang!" with a more descriptive and culturally appropriate sound effect.
*   Use "weir" instead of "fish weir" for conciseness.
*   Use "salmon" instead of "the salmon" for better flow.
*   Use "Little Okikirmui" instead of "little Okikirmui".
