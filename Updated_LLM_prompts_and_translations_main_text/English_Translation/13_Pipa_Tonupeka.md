沼貝が自ら歌った謡「トヌペカ ランラン」

トヌペカ ランラン
強烈な日光に私の居る所も
乾いてしまって今にも私は死にそうです.
「誰か,水を飲ませて下すって
助けて下さればいい.水よ水よ」と私たちが泣き叫んで
いますと,ずーっと浜の方から一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.
私たちは泣いていますと,私たちの傍を通り
私たちを見ると,
「おかしな沼貝,悪い沼貝,何を泣いて
うるさい事さわいでいるのだろう.」と言って
私たちを踏みつけ,足先にかけ飛ばし,貝殻と共につぶして
ずーっと山へ行ってしまいました.
「おお痛,苦しい,水よ水よ.」と泣き叫んで
いると,ずっと浜の方からまた一人の女が
籠を背負って来ています.私たちは
「誰か私たちに水を飲ませて助けて下さるといい,
おお痛,おお苦しい,水よ水よ.」と叫び泣きました
すると,娘さんは,神の様な美しい気高い様子で
私の側へ来て私たちを見ると,
「まあかわいそうに,大へん暑くて沼貝たちの
寝床も乾いてしまって水を欲しがって
いるのだね,どうしたのでしょう
何だか踏みつけられでもした様だが......」と言いつつ
私たちみんなを拾い集めて蕗の葉に
入れて,きれいな湖に入れてくれました.
清い冷水でスッカリ元気を恢復し
大へん丈夫になりました.そこで始めて
かの女たちの気性を探って
見ると,先に来て,私を踏みつぶした
にくらしい女,わるい女はサマユンクルの
妹で,私たちを憫み
助けて下さった若い娘さん淑しとやかな方
は,オキキリムイの妹なのでありました.
サマユンクルの妹は悪にくらしいので
その粟畑を枯らしてしまい,オキキリムイの
妹のその粟畑をばよく実らせました.
その年に,オキキリムイの妹は大そう多く収穫をしました.
私の故為せいでそうなった事を知って
沼貝の殻で粟の穂を摘みました.
それから,毎年,人間の女たちは
栗の穂を摘む時は沼貝の殻を使う様になったのです.
と,一つの沼貝が物語りました.

The Pond Snail's Own Song: "Tonupeka Ranran"

Tonupeka ranran,
Under the fierce sunlight, my home dries,
I feel as if I'm about to die.
"Someone, please give us water,
please help us! Water, water!" we cried.
Then, from the shore, a woman came,
a basket upon her back.
As we wept, she passed by us,
and seeing us, she said,
"Strange pond snails, wretched pond snails, why do you cry
and make such a noisy fuss?"
She trampled us, kicked us aside,
crushing us with our shells,
then went far into the mountains.
"Oh, it hurts, it's painful, water, water!" we cried.
Then, from the shore, another woman came,
a basket upon her back. We cried,
"Someone, please give us water and help us!
Oh, it hurts, oh, it's painful, water, water!"
Then, the maiden, with a divine and noble air,
came to my side and seeing us, she said,
"Oh, you poor things, it's so hot, the pond snails'
beds have dried up, and they thirst for water.
What has happened? It looks as if you've been trampled..."
As she spoke, she gathered us all up,
placed us on butterbur leaves,
and put us in a clear lake.
With the pure, cold water, we fully recovered,
and became very strong. Then, for the first time,
I investigated the nature of these women.
The hateful woman who came first and crushed me,
the wicked woman, was Samayunkur's
sister. The young maiden who pitied us
and helped us, the gentle and graceful one,
was Okikirmuy's sister.
Samayunkur's sister was evil and hateful,
so her millet field withered. Okikirmuy's
sister's millet field, however, flourished.
That year, Okikirmuy's sister harvested a great abundance.
Knowing it was because of me,
she harvested the millet ears with pond snail shells.
Since then, every year, human women
have used pond snail shells when harvesting millet ears.
So, a pond snail told the story.

This is the English Translation 2.
The Song of *Tonopeka Ranran*, sung by the clam itself:

*Tonopeka Ranran*
The fierce sun has parched my dwelling,
I am weak, nearing death.
"Who will have mercy, grant us rain,
Save our lives? Water, water!" we cry.
Far off, from the direction of the shore, a woman approaches,
Carrying a bamboo basket.
As we weep, she passes by,
Sees us, and says:
"Loathsome *numakai*, wretched *numakai*, why do you cry,
Making such a racket, disturbing the peace!"
Having said this, she tramples us, kicks us with her toes, crushing us along with our shells,
And strides away, heading straight into the depths of the mountains.
"Ah, the pain is unbearable, the suffering immense, water, water!" we cry.
Far off, from the direction of the shore, another woman approaches,
Carrying a bamboo basket. We call out:
"If only someone would grant us rain, save our lives,
Ah, the pain is unbearable, the suffering immense, water, water!"
That woman, as beautiful and noble as a goddess,
Comes to our side, sees us, and says:
"Ah, how pitiful, the weather is so hot, the *numakai*'s
dwelling has dried up, longing for rain,
What on earth has happened?
It seems they have been trampled…"
Saying this, she picks us up one by one,
Places us in *fuki* leaves, and then places us in the clear lake water.
The clear, cool lake water completely restores our vitality,
Making us incredibly strong. And so, we begin to investigate
their natures.
It turns out, the loathsome woman who came earlier and trampled us,
the wicked woman, is *Samaunkur*’s
sister; while the young woman who pitied us,
the gentle and quiet woman who saved us,
is *Okikirmui*’s sister.
*Samaunkur*’s sister harbors malice,
causing her millet fields to wither and die; while *Okikirmui*’s
sister causes her millet fields to be abundant and rich.
That year, *Okikirmui*’s sister harvested a large amount of millet.
She knew this was because of me,
So she used the shells of the *numakai* to pluck the ears of millet.
From then on, every year, the women of humankind
use the shells of the *numakai* when plucking the ears of millet.
This, is the story told by a single *numakai*.

The Song of Tonupeka Ranran, as sung by the Numakai:

Tonupeka Ranran,
Beneath the sun's fierce gaze, my home has dried,
I weaken, close to death's embrace.
"Who will show mercy, grant us water's grace,
And save our lives? Water, water!" we cry in despair.

From the shore, a woman appears in the distance,
A basket of fuki upon her back.
As we weep, she passes us by,
Sees our plight, and scoffs with a disdainful sigh:
"Loathsome numakai, wretched numakai, why do you cry,
Making such a racket, disturbing the tranquil sky!"

With cruel intent, she tramples us underfoot,
Kicks us aside with her toes, crushing shell and root,
Then strides away, her path towards the mountains set.
"Ah, the pain is unbearable, the suffering, we can't forget! Water, water!" our cries still echo, wet.

Again, from the shore, another woman draws near,
A basket of fuki upon her back, banishing fear.
We plead, "If only someone would grant us water's kiss,
And save our lives from this agonizing abyss!
Ah, the pain is unbearable, the suffering we can't dismiss, Water, water!"

That woman, with a divine and noble grace,
Approaches our side, a serene smile on her face:
"Ah, how pitiful, the weather's cruel decree,
The numakai's dwelling has dried, longing to be free,
What on earth has happened? It seems they've suffered greatly..."

With gentle hands, she gathers us one by one,
Places us carefully in fuki leaves, beneath the sun,
Then carries us to the clear lake's embrace.
The cool, pure water restores our strength and grace,
Making us incredibly strong, in this tranquil place.

And so, we sought to understand their inner light,
To discern the nature of their souls, dark or bright.
It turns out, the loathsome woman, filled with spite,
Who trampled us with all her wicked might,
Is Samaunkur's sister, shrouded in endless night.

While the young woman, who pitied our despair,
The gentle and quiet one, beyond compare,
Who saved us with kindness and loving care,
Is Okikirmui's sister, with goodness to share.

Samaunkur's sister harbors malice deep,
Causing her millet fields to wither and weep,
While Okikirmui's sister, her promise to keep,
Causes her millet fields to flourish, harvest to reap.

That year, Okikirmui's sister, with joy in her heart,
Harvested a bounty, a work of art.
She knew it was because of me, a brand new start,
So she used the shells of the numakai, playing her part,
To pluck the ears of millet, right from the very start.

From then on, every year, the women of humankind,
Remember the numakai, their purpose defined,
Use the shells of the numakai, a treasure to find,
When plucking the ears of millet, their destinies aligned.

This, is the story told by a single numakai, a tale of its kind.

After carefully comparing the two English translations with the original Japanese text, I've identified the strengths and weaknesses of each. Translation 2 excels in retaining original terms like 'Tonopeka Ranran' and 'numakai,' providing a richer cultural context. However, it occasionally sounds less natural in English. Translation 1 is generally more accessible and flows better, but it loses some of the original flavor by translating all terms. I've chosen to create a new translation that balances accuracy, understandability, and poetic flow, incorporating the best aspects of both previous versions.
