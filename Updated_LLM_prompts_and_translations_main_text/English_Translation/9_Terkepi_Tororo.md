蛙が自らを歌った謡
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」

トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!
「ある日に,草原を飛び廻って
遊んでいるうちに見ると,
一軒の家があるので戸口へ行って
見ると,家の内に宝の積んである側に
高床がある.その高床の上に
一人の若者が鞘を刻んでうつむいて
いたので,私は悪戯をしかけようと思って敷居の上に
坐って,「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴いた,ところが,彼の若者は刀持つ手を上げ
私を見ると,ニッコリ笑って,
「それはお前の謡かえ? お前の喜びの歌かえ?
もっと聞きたいね.」というので
私はよろこんで「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴くと,彼の若者のいう事には,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」
私はそれをきいて嬉しく思い下座の方の
炉縁の上へピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴くと
彼の若者のいうことには,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」それを聞くと私は,
本当に嬉しくなって,上座の方の炉縁の
隅のところへピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴いたら
突然!彼の若者がパッと起ち
上ったかと思うと,大きな薪の燃えさしを
取り上げて私の上へ投げつけた音は
体の前がふさがったように思われて,それっきり
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たら
芥捨あくすて場の末に,一つの腹のふくれた蛙が
死んでいて,その耳と耳との間に私はすわっていた.
よく見ると,ただの人間の家
だと思ったのは,オキキリムイ,神の様に
強い方の家なのであった,そして
オキキリムイだという事も知らずに
私が悪戯をしたのであった.
私はもう今この様につまらない死方,悪い死方
をするのだから,これからの
蛙たちよ,決して,人間たちに悪戯をするのではないよ.
と,ふくれた蛙が云いながら死んでしまった.

The Frog's Own Song
"Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"

Toro ro hanroku hanroku!
One day, as I hopped and played in the meadow,
I saw a house. I went to the doorway,
and inside, beside a pile of treasures,
was a raised platform. On that platform,
a young man was carving a sheath, his head bowed.
I thought to play a trick, so I sat on the threshold
and sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
Then, the young man raised the hand that held his knife,
looked at me, and smiled gently.
"Is that your song? Your song of joy?
I'd like to hear more," he said.
Pleased, I sang again, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
And the young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I'd like to hear it closer."
Hearing this, I was delighted and hopped down
to the hearth's edge on the lower side,
and sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
The young man said,
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I'd like to hear it closer."
Hearing this, I was truly happy, and hopped
to the corner of the hearth on the upper side,
and sang, "Toro ro hanroku hanroku!"
Suddenly! The young man leaped up,
or so I thought, and grabbed a large, burning log,
hurling it at me! The sound was as if the world in front of me collapsed, and after that, I knew nothing.
When I came to, I was at the edge of the refuse heap,
a bloated frog lay dead, and I was sitting between its ears.
Looking closely, I realized that what I thought was a mere human's house
was actually the home of Okikirmui, a god of immense power.
And without knowing it was Okikirmui,
I had played a trick.
Now, I am to die such a meaningless, wretched death.
Therefore, frogs of the future, never,
ever play tricks on humans."
And with those words, the bloated frog died.

This is the English Translation 2.
The Frog's Self-Sung Ballad:
"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!
"One day, as I hopped and played in the meadow,
I spied a dwelling and went to its door to peek.
Inside, treasures piled high, beside a raised bed.
A young man sat upon it, head bent, carving a knife sheath.
A mischievous thought struck me, so I sat upon the threshold,
And sang: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
The young man, hearing my voice, raised his knife-holding hand,
Looked at me, smiled brightly, and asked:
"Is this your song? Your joyful tune?
I long to hear it again."
Overjoyed, I sang once more: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
The young man then said:
"Is this your yukar? Your sakehau?
I wish to hear it closer."
At these words, my heart bloomed, and I leaped to the lower hearth's edge,
Singing: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
The young man persisted:
"Is this your yukar? Your sakehau?
I wish to hear it closer still."
Hearing this, I was beside myself with glee, and hopped to the corner of the upper hearth,
Singing loudly: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

Suddenly! The young man rose with a start,
Swift as the wind, he seized a massive, burning log,
And hurled it at me, and all went black,
And I knew no more.

When I awoke again,
I found myself at the edge of a garbage heap, transformed into a frog with a swollen belly,
Already dead, and I was sitting between its ears.

Looking closely, what I thought was a mere mortal's home,
Was in truth the dwelling of Okikirmui, a being of godlike power.
And I, not knowing him as Okikirmui,
Went there to play a prank.

Now I shall die in this insignificant, wretched way,
So I warn all future frogs, never again play tricks on humans."

Thus spoke the swollen frog, and breathed its last.

## The Frog's Tale

"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!

One bright day, as I hopped and played in the sunlit meadow,
I spotted a house and peeked inside its open door.
Treasures glittered within, piled beside a raised platform.
A young man sat there, head bowed, carefully carving a knife sheath.
A mischievous idea sparked in my froggy brain, so I perched upon the threshold,
And sang out: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

The young man paused, raising the hand with the knife,
He looked at me, a gentle smile gracing his lips, and asked:
"Is that your song? A joyful melody?
I'd love to hear it again."

Overjoyed by his interest, I sang once more: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

The young man then inquired:
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I wish to hear it closer."

My heart leaped with excitement! I hopped down to the lower edge of the hearth,
Singing: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

The young man persisted:
"Is that your yukar? Your sakehau?
I wish to hear it even closer."

Now truly thrilled, I hopped to the corner of the upper hearth,
Singing loudly: "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

Suddenly! The young man sprang to his feet,
Quick as lightning, he grabbed a massive, burning log,
And hurled it straight at me! Darkness crashed around me,
And I knew no more.

When I awoke, everything had changed.
I lay at the edge of a garbage heap, a bloated, dead frog,
And I was sitting right between its ears.

Looking closer, I realized that what I'd mistaken for a simple house,
Was in truth the dwelling of Okikirmui, a god of immense power.
And I, not knowing him as Okikirmui,
Had dared to play a foolish prank.

Now I must die this meaningless, wretched death.
So I warn all frogs of the future: never, ever play tricks on humans!"

Thus spoke the swollen frog, and with those final words, breathed its last.

## Analysis of Translations

**Translation 1: Pros and Cons**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Clear and straightforward language.
    *   Accurate in conveying the basic meaning.
    *   Uses simple vocabulary, making it easily accessible.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Lacks a poetic or storytelling tone.
    *   Some phrases are a bit clunky (e.g., "the hand that held his knife").
    *   Misses opportunities to enhance the narrative with vivid imagery.

**Translation 2: Pros and Cons**

*   **Pros:**
    *   More poetic and engaging language.
    *   Uses stronger verbs and descriptive adjectives.
    *   Captures the mischievous tone of the frog.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Some phrases are slightly archaic or overly dramatic (e.g., "my heart bloomed").
    *   The line breaks in the middle of sentences can disrupt the flow.
    *   The phrase "beside myself with glee" is a bit too strong for the context.

**Choice of Better Translation:**

Translation 2 is slightly better because it captures the poetic and storytelling tone of the original Japanese text more effectively. However, it needs some refinement to make it more accessible and less dramatic.

## Updated Translation Strategy

The updated translation will aim to combine the clarity of Translation 1 with the poetic flair of Translation 2. It will focus on:

*   Using vivid language to create a strong sense of imagery.
*   Maintaining a natural and modern English flow.
*   Ensuring accuracy in conveying the meaning of the original Japanese text.
*   Simplifying overly dramatic or archaic phrases.
*   Keeping the storytelling tone to engage the reader.
